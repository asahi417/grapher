U.S. seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding fell $55.1 billion to $1.046 trillion in the latest week.     Non-seasonally adjusted commercial paper outstanding - which some analysts consider a more reliable reading than the seasonally adjusted one since it has been distorted by the financial crisis - fell $53.3 billion to $951.6 billion.     U.S. non-seasonally adjusted foreign financial commercial paper outstanding fell $25.9 billion to $231.4 billion.      ((New York Treasury Desk +1-646-223-6300)),20140102144529nEMS0CRI4H,nEMS0CRI4H

Banks took 168.662 billion euros from the European Central Bank at its extended weekly refinancing operation on Monday, more than the 140 billion euros money market traders had forecast in a Reuters poll. [ID:nL3N0K61QP]     They also returned less than the full value of the ECB's former government bond purchase programme in the weekly sterilisation round on Monday. [ID:nL6N0K91VX]     The ECB made efforts to avoid any liquidity squeeze towards the end of the year and suspended repayments of its ultra-cheap loan until Jan. 15.     Excess liquidity - the amount of money in the market beyond which banks need for their day-to-day operations - fell to 269 billion euros on Thursday from around 275 billion euros on Tuesday. <ECBNOMLIQ=>     That was down from over 600 billion euros at the start of last year.      Concerns about the drop have supported Euribor rates since mid-November, though a spike in excess liquidity to just above 200 billion euros immediately prior to Christmas and towards the end of the year eased the upward pressure.     On Thursday, the three-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR3MD=>, traditionally the main gauge of unsecured bank-to-bank lending, fell to 0.284 percent from 0.287 percent.     The six-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR6MD=> eased to 0.387 percent from 0.389 percent, and the shorter-term one-week rate <EURIBORSWD=> dropped to 0.183 percent from 0.188 percent.

We know from flash readings two weeks ago that the euro zone's manufacturing and service sectors did well in December with new orders flooding in. But that masked a growing divergence between the bloc's top two economies with German factories enjoying their best month since June 2011 while activity among French firms sunk to a seven-month low.     Those readings are unlikely to change much, putting the focus on the surveys for Italy, Spain and Greece all of which have shown signs of life in recent months and for which we've had no prior release. All three are forecast to have shown further improvement last month.     Concern about the durability of the euro zone's recovery is increasingly centred on France, whose economy slipped back into contraction in the third quarter. The government has pushed through labour and pensions reforms despite domestic resistance but the changes have been dismissed as too timid by many abroad.     In his New Year address, President Francois Hollande offered French companies a responsibility pact to tackle unemployment, whereby they could benefit from lower labour taxes and  fewer restrictions on their activity in return for hiring more workers. With his poll ratings at all-time lows for a president, a great leap in policy is unlikely.     For her New Year message, Angela Merkel vowed to permanently resolve the bloc's debt crisis, not least because it is vital for Germany's interests. What flows from that remains to be seen. She then went on to focus on the need to put public finances in order. Hollande said he and Merkel would come up with new proposals on Europe early in the year.     Britain's PMI is unlikely to challenge a now well-established theme of rapid economic recovery after years spent in the doldrums, although a slight fall in the pace of expansion is predicted after November's survey hit a three-year high.     The short-term economic focus in Britain will be on the strength of consumer spending over Christmas. Department stores group John Lewis, which often outperforms the sector, has reported a 7.2 percent rise in Christmas sales. Rival Debenhams issued a profit warning on Tuesday after a hoped-for surge in last-minute shopping failed to materialise despite heavy discounting.     Turkey's new interior minister will be sworn in in parliament, replacing one of the three ministers who resigned after their sons were caught up in a corruption scandal which is rocking the country.     Efkan Ala will be the minister responsible for the judiciary and police force so we'll be looking for any statements about their independence and how they have been operating.     Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has responded to the corruption investigation by dismissing about 70 police officers involved in the probe and implicitly pointed the finger at Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Turkish cleric whose Hizmet movement claims at least a million followers, including senior police and judges.     After some dramatic losses last week, Turkish stocks and the lira rallied on Tuesday. The currency is steady early on today.

In what came as a surprise to some investors, the Fed last month decided to cut its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, by $10 billion to $75 billion per month. It reduced purchases of both Treasuries and mortgage bonds by $5 billion each.     It had been purchasing $45 billion in Treasuries each month.     The New York Fed, which carries out monetary policy in financial markets, will pare purchases broadly across a spectrum of securities maturing between 2018 and 2043, according to the plan.

The Senate is expected to vote at around 5:30 p.m. EST (2230 GMT) Monday on Yellen, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide.      Yellen, who would become the first woman to chair the U.S. central bank, would take the reins on Feb. 1, one day after Bernanke ends a two-term stint during which he reached deep into the Fed's monetary toolbox to try to revive an economy hit by a massive financial crisis that sent it into the worst downturn in decades.      Yellen has been deeply involved in the decisions to press the Fed into uncharted monetary policy waters, as the Fed's vice chair since 2010 and before that as chief of the San Francisco Fed.     As she steps into her new role, her biggest challenge will likely be to begin to pare back the Fed's crisis-era stimulus. The bank took a first step in that direction last month when policymakers voted to pare its massive bond-buying stimulus program to $75 billion a month from $85 billion.      The Senate on Dec. 20 voted 59-34 to move forward with Yellen's nomination, indicating she had enough support to win confirmation.      Bernanke's second four-year term expires on Jan. 31.

After enjoying their best run in 15 years last year, U.S. shares were expected to edge lower when trading begins. Further gains depend on stronger growth this year, and investors were looking to U.S. jobless claims and updated December PMI figures to gauge the improvement in the world's largest economy.     Manufacturing data from China overnight and on Wednesday proved disappointing [ID:nL3N0KC0DH]. Equivalent data that showed euro zone manufacturing running at its fastest rate since mid-2011 were not enough to lift shares.    The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> was down 0.3 percent before the U.S. open. It had started the day at a 5 1/2- year high. Earlier declines in Asia had left MSCI's 45-country share index <.MIWD00000PUS> down 0.5 percent.     We think it is a temporary blip in China, but that and also perhaps the data showing the contraction in Singapore's economy earlier, maybe gave the market a slight scare, said ABN Amro economist Aline Schuiling.                Traders showed more appetite for both growth-attuned commodities and the dollar. At the same time, they trimmed their holdings of safe-haven bonds.     Gold grabbed the limelight, climbing 1.5 percent to $1,220 an ounce <XAU=>. The move recouped some of the losses that made last year gold's worst in three decades. [GOL/]                   The buying spilled over into silver and copper, with dealers talking of demand from Chinese traders looking to pick up commodities on the cheap. Three-month LME copper <CMCU3> rose to its highest in seven months.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    Asset returns:              http://link.reuters.com/dub25t    Euro zone debt crisis       http://r.reuters.com/hyb65p    Currencies v dollar         http://link.reuters.com/tak27s   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>          DOLLAR FLEXES MUSCLE     Among major currencies, the main theme remained weakness in the yen. The euro also tumbled as the dollar flexed its muscles.     The greenback hovered near a five-year high versus the Japanese currency at 105.30 yen, with the focus on the Federal Reserve's gradually scaling back its bond-buying stimulus.     The euro dropped to 143.7870 yen <EURJPY=>, having clocked gains of 26 percent in 2013 to reach a five-year peak of 145.67. Against the dollar, it saw its biggest drop since mid-November, sinking almost a euro cent to $1.3656 <EUR=>.     Today is the first day where fundamentals work out again ... That's why there is pressure on euro/dollar, said Ulrich Leuchtmann, the head of currency research at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.     Dealers suspect the euro currency got support in recent weeks from the repatriation of funds by European banks and from the euro zone's expanding current account surplus. But a general assumption remains that rising U.S. Treasury yields will eventually lift the dollar.     Yields on U.S. 10-year paper are up at 2 1/2-year highs of 3.03 percent. Even shorter-dated rates have been rising as improving U.S. economic data justify the Federal Reserve's decision to scale back its asset-buying.     A speech by outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday may offer some more guidance on the central bank's plans.     Prices of German Bund futures <FGBLc1> fell to their lowest since September 2013 on Thursday as investors offloaded the top-rated bonds in favour of riskier assets. [GVD/EUR]     The premium Italian and Spanish bonds offer over benchmark German Bunds also sank to its lowest since mid-2011 as their manufacturing data beat expectations in both countries.    In oil markets, U.S. crude futures <CLc1> were trading 81 cents lower at $97.62 a barrel, while Brent dropped $1.25 to just below $110.00 <LCOc1>.

Gold grabbed the limelight with a 1.5 percent jump to $1,220 an ounce <XAU=>, recouping just a little of the losses that made last year its worst in three decades. [GOL/]     The buying spilled over into silver and copper, with dealers talking of demand from Chinese traders looking to pick up commodities on the cheap.     The other action was in the yen, which resumed its long decline on the back of speculation the Bank of Japan will ease policy further while other central banks stay put or begin to rein in the huge amounts of cash being pumped into the economy.     The drop in the yen has been viewed as positive for Japanese exports and corporate earnings, and a major reason its share markets outperformed all others last year.     After China's official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.0 in December [ID:nL3N0KC0DH], manufacturing indices for Europe and the United States will offer more ideas on how global industry was faring into the end of last year. <ECONG7>     Figures from the euro zone set a positive early tone as they showed manufacturing growing at the fastest rate since mid-2011 in December on brisk business in Germany and Italy, though a moribund French economy continued to weigh.     With producers reporting further growth of new orders, exports and backlogs of work, the stage is set for a good start to 2014, said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, which compiles the survey of purchasing managers.                European stocks <.FTEU3> had started the year at a 5-1/2 year high, but an initial push higher proved short-lived despite the upbeat data as London's FTSE <.FTSE>, Paris's CAC 40 <.FCHI> and Frankfurt's Dax <.GDAXI> dropped 0.5, 0.6 and 0.5 percent respectively.     Safe-haven European benchmark German bonds were also out of favour as investors continued to shed them in favour of riskier assets, while the euro <EUR=> sagged to a near one-week low as the dollar <.DXY> strengthened.          YEN HEADING LOWER     For the major currencies the main theme continued to be weakness in the yen.     The dollar hovered near a five-year high versus the Japanese currency at 105.35 yen, with the focus on whether U.S. data later in the day will support the case for the Federal Reserve gradually scaling back its bond-buying stimulus.     The euro steadied at 144.70 yen <EURJPY=>, having clocked up gains of 26 percent over 2013 to reach a five-year peak of 145.67. On the dollar it was down to $1.3733 <EUR=>, but still not far from its recent two-year peak of $1.3892.     Dealers suspect the single currency has been supported by the repatriation of funds by European banks and a large and expanding current account surplus in the euro zone.            But there remains a general assumption that rising U.S. Treasury yields will eventually lift the dollar up on the euro.     Yields on U.S. 10-year paper are up at two-and-a-half year highs of 3.03 percent. Even shorter-dated rates have been rising as improving U.S. economic data justifies the Federal Reserve's decision to start tapering its asset-buying.     Prices of German Bund futures <FGBLc1> fell to their lowest since September 2013 on Thursday as investors continued to offload the top-rated bonds in favour of riskier assets. [GVD/EUR]     U.S. business and jobless claims data are due later and a speech by outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke on Friday may offer some more guidance on the central bank's tapering plans.     In oil markets, U.S. crude futures <CLc1> were trading 22 cents higher on Thursday at $98.64 a barrel, while Brent added 20 cents to $111.00 <LCOc1>.     Having ended last year essentially flat, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> fell 0.5 percent on Thursday.

Although the Italian economy is slowly emerging from its longest post-war crisis, lending has not caught up yet and continued to fall at an accelerating pace. Loans to firms shrank 4.9 percent in October from the same month a year earlier.     In a positive development for lenders, private-sector deposits picked up in November with a 0.5 percent rise from the previous month.     In Malta, bank lending to firms also shrank at a record pace, declining at an annual decline of 10.4 percent, the data showed.      Spain's decline in corporate borrowing in November was still the fastest on annual basis, at 13.5 percent below the level a year earlier.     One factor which could have made banks more hesitant to lend is a bank asset-quality review the ECB will conduct this year.      Before the ECB starts supervising banks from November next year, it will run a series of tests on the euro zone's largest lenders to uncover potential balance-sheet risks and capital shortfalls.     The asset-quality review is based on banks' balance sheet at the end of 2013. ECB policymakers have admitted that could have crimped lending in the last months of last year.

Private-sector deposits rose by 0.8 percent to 35.4 billion euros after a 1.3 percent fall in October, European Central Bank data showed on Friday.     The deposits are still 30 percent below their peak of 50.5 billion euros in May of 2012.     Banks on the island were shut for nearly two weeks in March after Cyprus agreed a 10-billion-euro bailout, which forced major depositors to pay part of the cost of the rescue.      Capital controls are still in place on the island, with limits on how much people can transfer from their accounts. Cyprus is gradually easing the controls.     The data showed that deposits in other southern European countries mired in the debt crisis remained relatively stable.     Private-sector deposits rose by 0.7 percent in Spain and by 0.5 percent in Italy and Greece in November. They inched up in Portugal and were down slightly in Ireland and Slovenia.     Monthly fluctuations in the figures are common, though sharp consecutive drops in countries with stable banking systems are unusual.     The data, which are for all currencies combined, are not seasonally adjusted and differ slightly from national central bank figures. They exclude deposits from central government and banks.

Businesses and household deposits rose to 161.04 billion euros ($219.95 billion) from 160.38 billion euros in October, the Bank of Greece said.     Greek banks lost around 90 billion euros or a third of their deposit base after the country plunged into a debt crisis in late 2009, partly due to capital flight on fears of a euro zone exit.     About 17 billion euros returned to the banking system in the months following a mid-June 2012 election, which led to the formation of a new government and eased fears that Athens would leave the single currency.     The inflows helped ease banks' liquidity strains and their dependence on central bank funding but have dried up since March, when Cyprus was bailed out at the expense of bank deposit holders.

European Union rules came into force this month requiring Standard and Poor's, Moody's, Fitch and other credit ratings agencies that operate in Europe for the first time to lay out the dates on which they review a country's rating.     They could previously conduct and publish their market-moving reviews at a time of their own choosing and were accused by euro zone officials of exacerbating the region's debt crisis by downgrading the ratings of struggling countries at critical moments.     The rules are part of a raft of increased regulation on the agencies, which also came under fire for underestimating the risks of mortgage-related securities in the run-up to the 2007/08 global financial crisis.     All of the big three firms left it right until the year-end deadline to publish their calendars, resulting in a number of busy schedule periods that could make for volatile markets.     Mid-April looks particularly hectic; DBRS, a smaller Toronto-based firm, decides on the 11th whether or not to downgrade Italy and Spain, and Fitch does the same two weeks later.     If DBRS cuts one or both of them to B-grade territory it would mean their sovereign bonds would automatically be worth 5 percent less when swapped for cheap funding at the European Central Bank.     Before that, January gets the new system off with a bang. Moody's reviews Portugal, which is still working through its EU/IMF bailout, on the 10th. S&P follows suit on the 17th, the same day Moody's looks at Ireland, which emerged from its bailout last month, and Fitch casts the slide rule over the Netherlands.     On the 24th Moody's moves on to both the UK, one of the fastest-growing industrialised nations, and France, which is under threat of another downgrade, before February's headline date of the 14th, when it reviews Italy, the euro zone's second most indebted state relative to GDP.     The first few months of the year will be quite busy, said Citi analyst Nishay Patel. In the first quarter, there are eight publication dates for European sovereigns who currently have a negative outlook by either S&P or Moody's. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Factbox of euro zone ratings [ID:nL5N0JE23G] Diary of rating review dates [ID:nL6N0KC23J] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>         DOWNGRADE DIARY     The new rules are intended to make the ratings process more transparent and reduce the clout of the big three firms, but some policymakers warn they risk creating what one recently called a downgrade diary that traders could use to bet against vulnerable states. [ID:nL6N0G33FD]     Some also wonder whether countries might try to game the new system by delaying bad news until just after the review dates.     The rating firms will only be able to make changes outside the pre-set timetable in extreme cases, for example if a government falls or its finances undergo a significant change, for which the agency must provide a detailed explanation.     Ratings have to be published on a Friday either an hour before or after market hours.     One quirk of the new rules is that if a country in another part of the world is rated by an analyst based in Europe, those ratings are also subject to the new requirements.     For S&P that is roughly half the 127 countries it rates and includes most of Africa and the Middle East, and the story is similar for both Moody's and Fitch.

From gold to grain, raw materials will trade less in line not only with equities, but with each other - and are likely to fall, to boot. Thank a calm euro zone and the prospect of the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting back its bond purchases.     Historically, commodities and equities have tended to move independently of one another. But for most of the period since the stock market's March 2009 trough, the performance of the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodity index has closely tracked that of the MSCI World Index of stocks.     Distortive central bank policies and euro zone fears meant investors didn't really distinguish between the two asset classes. When stocks moved, commodity prices tended to move in the same direction, and by a similar amount.     Asset-inflating central banks did not totally overwhelm real-world supply and demand. Expensive crude oil has led to a surge in U.S. shale drilling and a glut of non-OPEC crude. A decade of pricey copper and iron ore has induced miners to bring giant new pits online, even as growth in Chinese demand for raw materials wanes.     The unusual correlations finally started to change over the summer and by early December there was little relationship to discern at all. Correlations between different commodities have also fallen.     Many raw materials prices are still high by historical standards, though. That should change if the Fed cuts its extraordinary support for the economy, as expected. In addition, the more normal monetary policy becomes, the greater the likelihood that individual commodities start trading more on their own fundamentals than anything else.     Cheaper raw materials would be a boon to industry. Consumers would welcome less expensive oil and grain. Softer metal prices would ease the impact of slower growth in China - at least until demand catches up with supply again. And commodities that no longer trade in lock-step with each other may even provide a boost to Wall Street's struggling trading desks. Prices set by fundamentals, not fear, would be good news all round.                      <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS:     www.breakingviews.com/TOPNewsSubscription          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>          CONTEXT NEWS      - The correlation between the Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB commodity index and MSCI World Index of stocks fell from close to 1 in July - indicating a high positive correlation between the two indices - to minus 0.8 in September and October.

In early December the correlation between the indices was close to zero.     - Positive correlations between individual commodities - from crude oil to cocoa - have also fallen sharply.

Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein told economists at a conference on Friday that financial firms outside of traditional banking are less stable because they rely less on cash deposits, deposit insurance and access to government support.      Shadow banking is a nebulous sector of finance that comes in many forms - from payday loans and crowdfunding websites on Main Street, to securitized products, money-market funds and repurchase agreements on Wall Street.     It remains largely unregulated, which is a concern to many economists.     Shadow banking money is much more run prone than bank money, Stein said in comments that did not touch on the health of the economy or the outlook for monetary policy.     Part of the reason for this instability, Stein said, is that non-bank financial institutions often give investors the option to seize collateral in a transaction at a moment's notice.     Shadow banking was a key factor in the collapse of Lehman Brothers at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, which led to a raft of new regulations for bank capital and derivatives trading.

Consider that the guiding philosophy for our annual attempt at agenda-setting financial foresight. (Download the e-book here: http://link.reuters.com/wug75v )     We do expect to get a few key prognostications right. A year ago we argued that U.S. stocks would best the rest of the world. Bingo. We said central banks would need to fight to retain their independence from politicians. Look no further than the summer's public tussle over who should lead the U.S. Federal Reserve. We also predicted the Japanese yen would crest above the three-digit mark against the dollar: domo arigato Kuroda-san.     Not all of our views hit the mark. Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Credit Suisse <CSGN.VX> are still led by chief executives whose tenures we thought might come to an end in 2013. George Osborne still reigns as the UK's chancellor of the exchequer despite our skepticism a year ago. And while we predicted a great American newspaper would change hands in 2013, we should have opted for the Washington Post, which was sold to Amazon <AMZN.O> founder Jeff Bezos, over the New York Times <NYT.N>.     This year our views have been divvied up into six sections: people and power, money and markets, buys and sells, fees and fortunes, mergers and manias, and odds and ends. In the first category, look for India's next prime minister to channel Japanese leader Shinzo Abe in reviving his economy. For Latin America, commodity price deflation will make governance matter for a change, giving Mexico a chance to shine.     The highly anticipated tapering of bond buying by the Federal Reserve will be the obvious story of the financial markets. Optimists say it's all priced in, but they may not be prepared for 10-year Treasury bond yields of 4 percent. Ditto the great American oil boom: abundant supply should keep energy inflation at bay for another year.     In the corporate world, activism will keep more companies on their toes, including General Electric <GE.N>, which has thus far managed to keep uppity investors calm. Among other predictions: America's gun bubble is poised to burst, the booming solar business will hit electric utilities, Siemens' <SIEGn.DE> new chief faces rising pressure for a turnaround, and some Chinese corporations will warrant newfound attention from investors.     On Wall Street, look for Wells Fargo <WFC.N> to snatch more market share from established titans, while prosecutors scramble for new targets after shaking down JPMorgan and hedge-fund manager Steve Cohen. Mergers and acquisitions activity will continue, but not meet the ardent expectations of its Hermès-tied practitioners. And don't be surprised if Chinese antitrust watchdogs flex their muscles.     There are other odds and ends to consider in the coming year, such as which buzzwords will proliferate following a 2013 rich in visionary and disruptive behavior. And investors may get glimpses of hot new firms like Square, Pinterest and the shared economy favorite Airbnb. There will be sport, as the World Cup puts the spotlight on Brazil. And in case you're wondering, Germany will walk away with the trophy.      Read Predictions 2014 in the spirit in which it has been written. And whether we are spot-on or just half-right, know that Breakingviews will work tirelessly to explore the coming year with the insight, analysis, speed and common sense you have come to expect.                <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS: www.breakingviews.com/TOPNewsSubscription             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>       - For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on [COX/]        (Editing by Jeffrey Goldfarb and Martin Langfield)  ((rob.cox@thomsonreuters.com)(Reuters messaging rob.cox.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))  Keywords: BREAKINGVIEWS PREDICTIONS/",20140102164115nL2N0KC0GW,nL2N0KC0GW

The Baltic country of just 2 million people became the bloc's 18th member at midnight (2200 GMT), taking a step further out of the shadow of neighbouring Russia a decade after joining the European Union and NATO.     Latvia's acting prime minister, Valdis Dombrovskis, who led his country through its worst economic crisis since it left the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s, said euro adoption was an opportunity, but not a guarantee of wealth, and the country should not relax its fiscal policy.     It's not an excuse not to pursue a responsible fiscal and macroeconomic policy, he said after withdrawing the first euro banknote after midnight from a cash machine in Riga.     The euro switchover ceremony took place at a site where Latvia's crisis began - the former headquarters of the collapsed Parex bank, now headquarters of state-owned Citatele bank, which emerged from Parex's ruins.     Parex, the country's second-biggest bank by assets, went bust at end-2008, forcing the Baltic state to seek an international rescue to keep its currency, the lat, pegged to the euro at the same rate.     Its economy shrank by a quarter during 2008-2010, but then grew at the fastest pace in the EU, expanding by 5.6 percent in 2012, after the government slashed spending and wages and hiked taxes in one of the harshest austerity programs in Europe.     Latvia's efforts have won praise from EU policymakers, who have pointed numerous times to the Baltic state as an example that austerity can work.     Thanks to these efforts ... Latvia will enter the euro area stronger than ever, sending an encouraging message to other countries undergoing a difficult economic adjustment, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Tuesday.     Still, a few concerns remain. The European Central Bank has warned Latvia that the high level of foreign deposits, mostly from Russia, in Latvian banks, as in Cyprus, was a risk factor.     Latvia also enters the euro zone without a permanent government after Dombrovskis resigned in December, taking political responsibility over a supermarket collapse in Riga that killed 54 people.[ID:nL5N0JC3M1]     Latvia enters the euro zone as the single currency bloc marks its 15th anniversary, and the euro is now used by 333 million Europeans.     Even so, neighbouring Lithuania is the only remaining EU country showing much enthusiasm for euro admission after the temptations and strains of sharing a currency forced Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Cyprus to seek international bailouts for their government finances or their banks.          Estonia joined the euro zone in 2011, and Lithuania aims to do so in 2015.     Among the ex-Communist EU countries that have yet to adopt the euro, Croatia is stuck in recession while bigger economies such as Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary have become reticent about currency union.      Latvia, which becomes the fourth smallest economy in the euro zone after Malta, Estonia and Cyprus, expects the euro to lower its borrowing costs and encourage investors by eliminating currency risk.     Both Standard & Poor's and Fitch have raised the country's credit ratings in anticipation of its euro entry.     But opinion polls show ordinary Latvians are divided on the  euro's merits, with many worried that its adoption will be an excuse to raise prices.[ID:nL3N0IC3XC]     In all other countries which had switched to the euro, prices rose. Most likely, they will rise here as well, which is bad, said Oleg Bachurin, 62, a pensioner.     Latvia's central bank expects euro zone entry to lift consumer prices by 0.2-0.3 percentage point in 2014, taking inflation to 2 percent.[ID:nL5N0IF2F5]     I'm not worried (about euro adoption). I believe it's progress. We should not look back, we should go forward, said Anita Linde, 57, a retailer.

Lacker explained that the Fed has the ability to control short-term interest rates, in part because it pays interest on the excess reserves banks hold at the Fed.      Lacker is a strong opponent of the Fed's recent bond-buying programs, and he supported the Fed's move last month to start winding down its most recent round of asset purchases.      Lacker also said he expects the U.S. dollar to remain the world's reserve currency for years to come.

Spanish and Italian inflation numbers for December will be of interest given the debate about deflation in the euro zone, though it will be the figure for the bloc as a whole next week that will really move that story on, coming just before the European Central Bank's first policy meeting of the year.     Spanish annual inflation is running at just 0.2 percent while the Italian number is little higher, forecast to come in at 0.6 percent.     The ECB insists there is no chance of a Japan-style downward spiral of prices and economic activity but Mario Draghi said last week he and his colleagues had to make sure inflation didn't get stuck in the danger zone below 1 percent.     Euro zone money supply figures will show if there has been any revival in bank lending; unlikely with most analysts expecting activity to remain severely curtailed until the ECB's health test of the big banks are out of the way late this year. That will do nothing to revive economic growth.     As with inflation (-2.9 percent in Greece, +1.6 percent in Germany) the problem with bank lending is fragmentation. In the hardest hit parts of the bloc, lending is much more difficult to come by and if it is available it comes at a significantly greater cost.     No such problems in Britain - rather the reverse in fact. The Nationwide Building Society has just reported the biggest jump in UK house prices in more than four years, up 8.4 percent year-on-year nationally and probably up much more dramatically than that in London.     The Bank of England is already flexing its muscles, preparing to take some steam out of a market also being pumped up by a government help-to-buy scheme. It wants to do so without raising interest rates but the odds are falling on a tightening before the year is out, much earlier than the Bank has signalled.     Later, we get Britain's December construction PMI survey, interesting to see if housebuilding is picking up, and mortgage lending and consumer credit numbers - all of which could combine to put more pressure on Mark Carney and co.     Another focus is how lavishly consumers spent over Christmas. So far, department stores group John Lewis, which often outperforms the sector, has reported a 7.2 percent rise in sales. Rival Debenhams issued a profit warning after heavy discounting failed to lure shopper while House of Fraser did much better.     Hot off the press: Next, Britain's second largest clothing retailer, has raised its annual profit forecast after fourth quarter sales came in significantly ahead of its previous guidance.     Elsewhere, Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan meets his Libyan counterpart Ali Zeidan.     Turkish markets have calmed after a bruising last week of the year as Erdogan dismissed about 70 police officers involved in a corruption investigation which has dragged in relatives of ministers and others with close links to the government.

The result was a pullback in the euro, sterling, and Asian stocks and a bounce for the yen, gold and bonds. Oil prices also took a spill, though for largely separate reasons.     Europe's pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 share index <.FTEU3> struggled to fight the tide. It moved in and out of negative territory in early trading before finally gaining 0.3 percent. [.EU]     MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> had earlier shed 1 percent, with markets from Shanghai to Sydney all in the red.     The various moves seemed divorced from the news flow, which was mostly upbeat. Global manufacturing ended 2013 on a strong note as the United States, Japan and Germany all saw demand pick up. [TOP/CEN] The problem was China, where a measure of activity in the services sector slipped back in December, just as one for manufacturing had on Thursday.     In currencies, the euro weakened as speculators booked profits on long positions after a strong 2013. The common  currency was testing a six-week low at $1.3635 <EUR=> after shedding a full cent overnight.     The same forces gripped sterling, another strong performer in recent months. The pound peeled away to $1.6450 <GBP=> from a 28-month peak of $1.6605.     Going the other way, the yen enjoyed a short-covering bounce. Borrowing in yen to buy higher-yielding assets has been a popular trade, leaving the market vulnerable to sudden, if usually brief, reversals.     In this case, the dollar came off to 104.20 yen <JPY=> after rising as high as 105.44 on Thursday, its strongest since October 2008. The euro retreated to 142.10 yen <EURJPY=> from a peak of 145.12 on Thursday.      The yen is strong because it remains the major currency market's best proxy for risk, so when you have a strong correction lower in risk appetite that sees the yen supported, said John Hardy head of FX strategy for Saxo bank in Copenhagen. I suspect it is a bit of a knee-jerk consolidation at the start of the year, but it is interesting that it started that way          GOLD SHINES     Another source of anxiety in Asia had been Thailand. Growing political uncertainty lopped another 0.5 percent off stocks, after a 5 percent decline on Thursday <.SETI>. The Thai currency also took a bath, hitting its lowest since early 2010 at 33.03 per dollar <THB=TH>.     The short-covering theme meanwhile extended to U.S. Treasury debt, which has been under pressure for pretty much all of the past two months. Yields on the 10-year note dipped to 2.97 percent from a top of 3.04 percent, which had been the highest since mid-2011.      German <DE10YT=TWEB> and other top-rated European government bonds mirrored the moves as they opened. [GVD/EUR]     Gold was another beaten-down asset to get a reprieve, along with silver <XAG=> and platinum <XAG=>. Bullion had swung up to $1,233 <XAU=> after the early flurry of trading in London, from as low as $1,183.80 early in the week. [GOL/]     Positive bullion prices in reaction to the decline in equities may set the tone for 2014 and reinforce the negative correlation between the two, HSBC analysts said in a note.     Oil prices steadied after taking a fall on Thursday as Libya prepared to restart a major oilfield and on speculation of a sharp rise in crude stockpiles in the United States.     Brent crude <LCOc1> edged up 70 cents to $108.50 a barrel but that followed a drop of $2.98 on Thursday. U.S. crude <CLc1> was up 19 cents at $95.60, after shedding almost $5 the day before.

The ECB has cut interest rates to a record low, pumped extra liquidity into the banking system and announced a yet-to-be-used government bond purchase programme, but the measures have so far not reached all corners of the euro zone evenly.     Worryingly, there is still no sign of any trend change in bank lending to euro zone businesses, which heaps pressure on the ECB to act, said Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS Economics.      Banks likely believe the economic situation and outlook in many euro zone countries still provides an uncertain and risky backdrop in which to lend, despite the euro zone eking out modest growth since the second quarter.     The ECB's upcoming health check of banks' balance sheets is exacerbating the situation, with lenders reluctant to take on more risk and trying to slim down their loan books instead.     ECB Vice-President Vitor Constancio said last month that about two-thirds of the weakness in bank lending is due to a lack of demand from firms and households, with credit supply having some impact on the slump.     The ECB is unlikely to launch new measures when it meets next week after its president, Mario Draghi, said earlier this week there was no need for immediate action.        But over the next couple of months, the ECB could, for example, decide to stop sterilising the value of its previous government bond purchases, especially as it has now failed to take out the full amount for three weeks in a row. This would leave more liquidity in the system.          LENDING GAP      Corporate borrowing in the euro zone overall declined at the fastest pace on record, November's 3.9 percent drop comparing with a 3.8 percent decline on the year in the previous month.      The biggest decline was in Spain, where lending to companies fell 13.5 percent, although the contraction was less steep than in October.     Bank lending to Italian firms fell at an annual pace of 5.9 percent in November, the sharpest decline in the measure's 10-year history. That was also true for the euro zone's smallest economy, Malta, which recorded a 10.4 percent drop.     Only five euro zone countries saw corporate lending grow in November, with France the only large economy among them. Finland showed the biggest increase, of 5.4 percent.     Companies in Finland pay an interest rate on loans roughly one-third of that charged to their counterparts in Greece and Cyprus, ECB data from October showed. The big variance in borrowing costs for firms across the euro zone - now expanded to 18 members following Latvia's accession on Jan. 1 - is cited as one reason for the uneven levels of corporate lending.      This divergence has persisted since the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis in 2010 and has become a real headache for the ECB, as its record-low interest rates do not benefit all parts of the currency bloc equally.     Euro zone M3 money supply - a more general measure of cash in the economy - grew at an annual pace of 1.5 percent, picking up slightly from 1.4 percent in October and in line with the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.

Two years on, OGX is in default and the debt trades at less than 10 cents of its original face value.     The spectre of such defaults spreading across emerging markets has not yet dimmed investor enthusiasm for the corporate debt sector, which saw record-high bond sales of $330 billion-plus in 2013 and more than 150 first-time borrowers. [ID:nL6N0K21WW]          Banks predict similar issuance for 2014, although the default of OGX <OGXP3.SA> and others - from Mexican homebuilders to Kazakh banks - are raising fears fund managers in the $1.4 trillion sector may end up with huge losses.     Default rates are so far only creeping up, with a rate of 3.1 percent this year after 2.7 percent last year and 1.6 percent in 2010, JPMorgan data shows, but concerns over explosive growth and a sometimes blind dash for yield are growing.     Dollar borrowing by companies has swelled tenfold since 2001, drawing in Chilean car dealers, Nigerian banks and Ukrainian poultry farmers.      The 8.5 percent coupon paid by OGX <BR056294465=> persuaded buyers to overlook the fact it was yet to generate any revenues and did not offer the collateral against default that is common practice for a first-time issuer.     Investors are so far unfazed, with 65 funds launched in 2012 and 2013, specifically to invest in emerging corporate debt, according to data from Thomson Reuters company Lipper.     All this amounts to what Princeton University academic Hyun Song Shin terms the second phase of global liquidity, one where asset managers, rather than banks, have been the main players since 2010.     When the current lull in global financial conditions is eventually broken by tighter dollar funding conditions due to U.S. Federal Reserve monetary tightening, the vulnerabilities (of emerging companies) are likely to be exposed once more, Shin said in a recent paper.     At the heart of this thesis is the issue of currency mismatch - where revenues or assets are in local currencies but  debt is increasingly in dollars, a contradiction that may become more stark in future if the dollar strengthens.         Shin says the magnitude of the mismatch is underestimated because a large portion of the bonds are issued by U.S. or U.K.-based subsidiaries of emerging markets firms, but capital set aside by the parent firms to protect against default is usually in emerging currencies such as roubles or pesos.     So any wholesale deposit withdrawals by companies that run into trouble with their debt could in turn cause banking crises in the developing world.     Shamaila Khan, a portfolio manager at AllianceBernstein, says default rates will creep higher, but not explode. You will see some of the repercussions of indiscriminate funding because of all the inflows the sector has received.          OVERBLOWN     Khan estimates default rates of 3.0-3.5 percent in 2013 and 2014. While that is far off the 10 percent rate seen in 2009 or the 30 percent rate of the late 1990s, it has risen off a 2011 trough of 0.6 percent.     Meanwhile not much corporate debt is due to be repaid in the near term, keeping the pressure off companies.     Rob Stewart, a client portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management, reckons the peak of debt maturities will fall in a decade or so from now, as bonds issued during the current boom come up for redemption.     The market is highly diversified, with a large number of countries, sectors and companies, so risks to asset managers from a default in one company or region are not high, he said.     It is also far too early to worry about a systemic crisis rooted in currency mismatch, says David Spegel, head of emerging debt strategy at ING Bank in New York.     He notes firstly that two-thirds of outstanding debt comes from energy and metals companies that have natural hedges in place in the form of hard currency revenues. Others, notably banks, often hedge bond payments via swaps during issuance.     Third, debt issued by external subsidiaries of emerging companies amounts to around $670 billion, Spegel calculates. But this comprises just 3 percent of the $19.5 trillion that is in bank deposits in the highest-risk countries, he says.     In most cases, EM bank deposits are high enough to curb the suggested threat for the financial system, Spegel said.     And prices compensate for risks, many argue. Bill Perry, head of the corporate investment team at Stone Harbor Investments, notes the substantial yield premia that high-yield company debt offers, to U.S. Treasuries as well as junk-rated U.S. credit.     You are getting a 200 bps in pick up when you pick EM high-yield over (developed market) high yield. You get paid a pickup and you get a comparable default rate, Perry said.     Often when you buy high-yield names from emerging markets, you are buying very solid companies, they just come from the wrong zip code.

European Union rules came into force this month requiring Standard and Poor's, Moody's, Fitch and other credit ratings agencies that operate in Europe for the first time to lay out the dates on which they review a country's rating.     They could previously conduct and publish their market-moving reviews at a time of their own choosing and were accused by euro zone officials of exacerbating the region's debt crisis by downgrading the ratings of struggling countries at critical moments.     The rules are part of a raft of increased regulation on the agencies, which also came under fire for underestimating the risks of mortgage-related securities in the run-up to the 2007/08 global financial crisis.     All of the big three firms left it right until the year-end deadline to publish their calendars, resulting in a number of busy schedule periods that could make for volatile markets.     Mid-April looks particularly hectic; DBRS, a smaller Toronto-based firm, decides on the 11th whether or not to downgrade Italy and Spain, and Fitch does the same two weeks later.     If DBRS cuts one or both of them to B-grade territory it would mean their sovereign bonds would automatically be worth 5 percent less when swapped for cheap funding at the European Central Bank.     Before that, January gets the new system off with a bang. Moody's reviews Portugal, which is still working through its EU/IMF bailout, on the 10th. S&P follows suit on the 17th, the same day Moody's looks at Ireland, which emerged from its bailout last month, and Fitch casts the slide rule over the Netherlands.     On the 24th Moody's moves on to both the UK, one of the fastest-growing industrialised nations, and France, which is under threat of another downgrade, before February's headline date of the 14th, when it reviews Italy, the euro zone's second most indebted state relative to GDP.     The first few months of the year will be quite busy, said Citi analyst Nishay Patel. In the first quarter, there are eight publication dates for European sovereigns who currently have a negative outlook by either S&P or Moody's. <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Factbox of euro zone ratings [ID:nL5N0JE23G] Diary of rating review dates [ID:nL6N0KC23J] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>         DOWNGRADE DIARY     The new rules are intended to make the ratings process more transparent and reduce the clout of the big three firms, but some policymakers warn they risk creating what one recently called a downgrade diary that traders could use to bet against vulnerable states. [ID:nL6N0G33FD]     Some also wonder whether countries might try to game the new system by delaying bad news until just after the review dates.     The rating firms will only be able to make changes outside the pre-set timetable in extreme cases, for example if a government falls or its finances undergo a significant change, for which the agency must provide a detailed explanation.     Ratings have to be published on a Friday either an hour before or after market hours.     One quirk of the new rules is that if a country in another part of the world is rated by an analyst based in Europe, those ratings are also subject to the new requirements.     For S&P that is roughly half the 127 countries it rates and includes most of Africa and the Middle East, and the story is similar for both Moody's and Fitch.

[ID:nL6N0JQ2OL]          BENOIT COEURE (EXECUTIVE BOARD), DEC. 11     Looking ahead, if we come to the conclusion that this (inflation staying too far below target) remains the case, we would have to act again.

I supported this decision because it was consistent with the linkage the (Fed's policy-setting) committee established between the asset purchase program and the outlook for labor market conditions, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Maryland Bankers Association. I expect further reductions in the pace of purchases to be under consideration at upcoming meetings.      The Fed decided last month to trim $10 billion from its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, after unemployment fell to a five-year low of 7 percent.     The U.S. central bank had said it would continue the program, its third round of bond purchases, until it saw substantial improvement in the job market outlook. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke signaled in December that the program could be fully shuttered by late 2014.      Since the program began in late 2012, we've seen a substantial improvement in a variety of indicators of labor market conditions, including the unemployment rate and the level of employment, Lacker said. So it made sense to initiate the process of bringing the program to a close.     Notably, Lacker did not mention the potential downsides of the program; cumulatively, the Fed's three rounds of bond buying so far have brought the Fed's balance sheet to nearly $4 trillion. In a December speech Lacker voiced concern that a large balance sheet could make an exit from stimulative policy difficult, a comment that was absent in Friday's otherwise largely similar speech.     The outlook for the U.S. economy has brightened in recent weeks with the labor market and factory sector strengthening, and Lacker said the stronger growth could be a harbinger of more gains this year.     But experience with similar growth spurts in the recent past suggests that it is too soon to make that call, he warned, saying that he expects growth in gross domestic product, which grew at a brisk 3.6 percent annual pace in the third quarter, to come in at about 2 percent this year.      He also forecast inflation to rise back toward the Fed's 2 percent goal in the next year or two.

The Federal Reserve is currently buying $75 billion a month in Treasuries and mortgage bonds in its third round of quantitative easing, or QE3, which is meant to ease longer-term borrowing costs in the economy.      Yet we still don't have well-developed macro-models that incorporate a realistic financial sector,' William Dudley, president of the New York Fed, told an economics conference.     We don't understand fully how large-scale asset purchase programs work to ease financial market conditions, there's still a lot of debate ... he said. Is it the effect of the purchases on the portfolios of private investors, or alternatively is the major channel one of signaling?

The U.S. central bank trimmed its quantitative easing program to $75 billion per month, from $85 billion, at a much anticipated policy meeting last month, reducing its extraordinary support for the U.S. economy.     It's good that we did it, Plosser, a hawkish Fed official, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference. But if the economy continues to grow and strengthen I think that there's no reason why we shouldn't want to consider speeding the process up if we can, he said.     I have no problem with gradually unwinding it, but my preference would be to move a little quicker and end it sooner rather than later, Plosser added.

The ex-employee, Carmen Segarra, said after examining Goldman's legal and compliance divisions for seven months, she found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of interest as required by regulation.      In a 30-page court document, lawyers for the New York Fed said some of Segarra's claims were implausible owing to numerous contradictions within her pleading.      Most glaringly, the allegation that Goldman Sachs did not  have any conflict of interest policy is belied by plaintiff's own exhibits, which show that the 'nonexistent' policies were, in fact, available on Goldman Sachs's public website, the document said.     Attorneys who filed the motion in federal court in the Southern District of New York and Segarra's lawyer, Linda Stengle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson also did not respond to a request for comment.       According to Segarra's lawsuit, the New York Fed's Legal Compliance and Risk team voted to downgrade Goldman's annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures as a result of  findings. She alleges that two New York Fed officials overseeing the Wall Street bank, Michael Silva and his deputy Michael Koh, were concerned a downgrade would hurt the Goldman's business.     Both Koh and Silva are named as defendants in Segarra's lawsuit, as well as her former supervisor, Johnathon Kim.     Segarra was assigned to Goldman's legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan Inc <KMI.N>. At that point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said.

Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said in a speech he is skeptical of so-called optimal control approaches to monetary policy in which mathematical models are used to predict when things like unemployment and economic growth will return to more normal levels.     Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen, who is set to take the reins at the U.S. central bank next month, has often touted this approach, including tolerating higher inflation for a short time in order to speed up the overall economic recovery.     While Yellen is a dovish backer of the Fed's aggressive stimulus, Plosser - who regains a vote on policy this year under the Fed's rotating system - is among the minority of hawks who oppose policies such as large-scale bond-buying.     Measures that arbitrarily, or by assumption, assign the bulk of fluctuation in GDP to purely temporary factors may provide poor policy guidance when shocks are more permanent in nature, he said in prepared remarks to the Korea-America Economic Association.     To recover from the recession, the U.S. central bank has held interest rates near zero since late 2008 to spur growth and hiring. It has also quadrupled the size of its balance sheet to around $4 trillion through three rounds of bond purchases aimed at holding down longer-term borrowing costs.     While gross domestic product growth rose above 4 percent in the third quarter, it has generally stayed closer to 2 percent since the recession ended in 2009, causing some to think that longer-term potential GDP growth is no longer the 3-percent rate to which Americans are accustomed. [ID:nL2N0IT28U]     If that is the case, the Fed's ultra easy policy stance - including promises to keep rates near zero for a while in order to drive down joblessness - may be misdirected.     The shock that hit the economy appears to have had very persistent, if not permanent, effects, Plosser said. From a statistical perspective, the economy appears to have taken a permanent hit to the output level.     Yellen and current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke have stressed the economic recovery has a long way to go, and that the Fed is committed to stimulus as long as needed. Yellen, who is expected to win Senate backing for the chairmanship on Monday, first mentioned an optimal control policy path in June, 2012. [ID:nL2N0JB1UO]     Plosser said he is skeptical on optimal control exercises that are derived from specific models and not on a variety of models.     A robust, systematic approach to policy, which is transparent and minimizes the degree to which data mismeasurement and model uncertainty affect policy, is the most promising approach to the uncertainties facing policymakers in real time, he said.

The ex-employee, Carmen Segarra, said after examining Goldman's legal and compliance divisions for seven months, she found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of interest as required by regulation.      In a 30-page court document, lawyers for the New York Fed said some of Segarra's claims were implausible owing to numerous contradictions within her pleading.      Most glaringly, the allegation that Goldman Sachs did not  have any conflict of interest policy is belied by plaintiff's own exhibits, which show that the 'nonexistent' policies were, in fact, available on Goldman Sachs's public website, the document said.     Attorneys who filed the motion in federal court in the Southern District of New York and Segarra's lawyer, Linda Stengle, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson declined to comment.       According to Segarra's lawsuit, the New York Fed's Legal Compliance and Risk team voted to downgrade Goldman's annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures as a result of  findings. She alleges that two New York Fed officials overseeing the Wall Street bank, Michael Silva and his deputy Michael Koh, were concerned a downgrade would hurt the Goldman's business.     Both Koh and Silva are named as defendants in Segarra's lawsuit, as well as her former supervisor, Johnathon Kim.     Segarra was assigned to Goldman's legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan Inc <KMI.N>. At that point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said.

A Senate vote is set for 5:30 p.m. (2230 GMT) on Yellen, 67, who has been vice chair of the U.S. central bank since 2010.     If confirmed, Yellen would succeed Ben Bernanke, whose second four-year term ends on Jan. 31.     In an early sign that Yellen commands enough support to win confirmation, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted 59-34 on Dec. 20 to move forward with the nomination.     President Barack Obama's choice of Yellen put her in line to become the first female chief of the powerful U.S. central bank in its 100-year history and just one of a handful of women heading central banks globally.     Yellen has been an unwavering advocate of the Fed's aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy as it struggled to emerge from a severe economic recession.     In late 2008, the Fed cut overnight interest rates to near zero and has since conducted a series of massive bond purchase programs intended to keep long-term borrowing costs low.     The result has been a falling U.S. jobless rate, which hit a five-year low in November of 7 percent as the pace of economic growth has also picked up.     Assuming the Senate approves her nomination, Yellen's main task will be to navigate the central bank's way out of its extraordinary stimulus, dialing down its current bond-buying program. The U.S. central bank trimmed that program to $75 billion per month, from $85 billion, at a much anticipated policy meeting last month.     During a mid-November Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination, Yellen defended the Fed's aggressive actions to foster economic growth and said, I consider it imperative that we do what we can to promote a very strong recovery.     Some Republicans expressed concerns the Fed may have gone too far. I think the economy has gotten used to the sugar you've put out there and I just worry that we're on a sugar high, Senator Mike Johanns of Nebraska said at the time.

Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren dissented against the central bank's landmark decision last month to reduce its bond-buying program by $10 billion to $75 billion in purchases per month. In a speech here, he repeated it was a mistake because unemployment remains too high and inflation too low.     Policymakers have the opportunity to be patient in removing accommodation, speeding up the process of achieving both elements of the Fed's dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and inflation of around 2 percent, he said.     U.S. unemployment has dropped from a post-recession high of 10 percent in 2009 to 7.0 percent in November, while inflation remains close to 1 percent.     Rosengren does not vote on policy this year under the Fed's rotating system.     On Dec. 18, the Fed cited a stronger job market and economic growth as it cut the quantitative easing program, or QE, amounting to the beginning of the end of the largest monetary policy experiment ever. [ID:nW1N0IY00G]     But Rosengren, who had earlier told Reuters he preferred to wait until March to cut QE, said on Saturday the risks of continuing the bond-buying at the previous $85-billion pace seem small relative to the risks of a permanent rise in the number of Americans who are out of work. [ID:nL2N0JZ1VW]     The failure of monetary and fiscal policy to generate a more rapid recovery risks creating a long-term structural unemployment problem out of a severe cyclical downturn. This concern also underlies my dissent, he said at a meeting of the American Economic Association.     While unemployment is at a five-year low, the proportion of those who have been unemployed for more than six months remains high, at almost 40 percent of those out of work.     Long-term unemployment has significant negative effects for individuals (and) the economy - for example through the atrophy of skills, Rosengren added.

Bernanke, who steps down as head of the U.S. central bank at month's end, gave an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy in coming quarters. But he tempered the good news in housing, finance and fiscal policies by repeating that the overall recovery clearly remains incomplete in the United States.     In what came as a surprise to some, the Fed decided last month to cut its asset-purchase program, known as quantitative easing or QE, by $10 billion to $75 billion per month. It cited a stronger job market and economic growth in its landmark decision, which amounted to the beginning of the end of the largest monetary policy experiment ever. [ID:nW1N0IY00G]     But that decision did not indicate any diminution of (the Fed's) commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed, Bernanke said at a American Economic Association forum in a snow-swept Philadelphia.     Rather, it reflected the progress we have made toward our goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook that we set out when we began the current purchase program in September 2012, he said according to prepared remarks.     To recover from the deep 2007-2009 recession, the Fed has held interest rates near zero since late 2008. It also has quadrupled the size of its balance sheet to around $4 trillion through three rounds of massive bond purchases aimed at holding down longer-term borrowing costs.     The Fed's extraordinary money-printing has helped drive stocks to record highs and sparked sharp gyrations in foreign currencies, including a drop in emerging markets last year as investors anticipated an end to the easing.     Looking into the years ahead, Bernanke said the central bank has the tools - including adjusting the rate on excess bank reserves and so-called reverse repurchase agreements, or repos - to return to a normal policy stance without resorting to asset sales.     It is possible, however, that some specific aspects of the Federal Reserve's operating framework will change, he said.     On the economy, Bernanke noted unemployment remains elevated at 7 percent, and said the number of long-term unemployed Americans remains unusually high.     But the combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary policy accommodation bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters, he said.     Of course, if the experience of the past few years teaches us anything, it is that we should be cautious in our forecasts.     Last month, Bernanke, who is set to be succeeded by Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen, said the purchases would likely be cut at a measured pace through much of this year if job gains continued as expected, with the program fully shuttered by late-2014.

Eonia <EONIA=>, an average of interest rates at which euro zone banks lend to each other overnight, surged to a two-year high of 0.446 percent at the end of 2013 as thin liquidity forced banks to overpay for cash, before falling back to 0.152 percent when markets returned to normal.     Banks stocked up on liquidity to ward off the market tension toward the end of the year, taking more than expected from the European Central Bank at its extended weekly refinancing operation last week. [ID:nL3N0K61QP]     The ECB made efforts to avoid any liquidity squeeze and suspended repayments of its long-term refinancing operations until Jan. 15.     The central bank is set to meet in Thursday to discuss monetary policy for the 18 countries that use the euro as their currency, but economists do not expect any change yet.     While the EONIA rate exhibited its usual end of year spike, with liquidity conditions simultaneously tightening owing to the larger LTRO paybacks before Christmas, we would expect the ECB to wait until the year-end disturbances have fully passed before thinking about taking action in the money market, Goldman Sachs wrote in a note.

Wall Street, in the grip of a snowstorm, was expected to see a quiet open after Thursday's poor start to 2014. With little data on tap, the focus will be on a speech by outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke for any fresh details on the bank's plans for stimulus withdrawal.     In Asia, where stocks suffered their toughest session in almost a month and a stack of major currencies fell against the safe-haven yen, investors had taken fright at more weak data from Beijing.     A measure of activity in China's services sector slipped back in December, just as one for manufacturing had on Thursday. [ID:nL3N0KD07F]         Asian activity was interesting because we had the PMI number from China which was disappointing, said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley. The Asian stock markets came off and consistent with that there was some yen buying.     European stocks fared better as global manufacturing ended 2013 on a strong note with the United States, Japan and Germany all seeing demand pick up. [TOP/CEN]     Having tumbled on Thursday and seen an indecisive start to Friday, the benchmark FTSEurofirst 300 index <.FTEU3> rose 0.4 percent, also helped by some upbeat Christmas retailers and weak euro zone lending data likely to keep easing on the ECB's agenda.

Having spent much of the day testing a six-week low, the common currency had recovered slightly to 1.3652 <EUR=> by mid-afternoon.     The same forces gripped sterling, another strong performer in recent months. The pound peeled away to $1.6424 <GBP=> from a 28-month peak of $1.6605 amid a slump in UK business lending. [ID:nL9N0IM021]     The yen enjoyed a short-covering bounce. Borrowing in yen to buy higher-yielding assets has been a popular trade, leaving the market vulnerable to sudden, if usually brief, reversals.     The dollar came off to 104.35 yen <JPY=> after rising as high as 105.44 on Thursday, its strongest since October 2008. The euro retreated as low as 142.10 yen <EURJPY=> from a peak of 145.12 on Thursday.     The yen is strong because it remains the major currency market's best proxy for risk, so when you have a strong correction lower in risk appetite that sees the yen supported, said John Hardy head of FX strategy for Saxo bank in Copenhagen.     I suspect it is a bit of a knee-jerk consolidation at the start of the year, but it is interesting that it started that way          GOLD SHINES     Another source of anxiety in Asia had been Thailand. Growing political uncertainty lopped another 0.5 percent off stocks there after a 5 percent decline on Thursday <.SETI>. The Thai currency also took a bath, hitting its lowest since early 2010 at 33.03 per dollar <THB=TH>.     However, as the tensions wore off in Europe, bond markets found their recent rhythm again.     The short-covering pressure that had extended to U.S. Treasury debt started to ease allowing yields on the 10-year note to edge back up to a fraction below 3 percent having topped at 3.04 on Thursday, it's highest since mid-2011.      German and other top-rated European government bonds largely mirrored the moves, while Spanish yields hit their lowest level since September 2010 as encouraging jobless data boosted sentiment.[GVD/EUR]      Oil prices also steadied after taking a fall on Thursday as Libya prepared to restart a major oilfield and on speculation of a sharp rise in crude stockpiles in the United States.     Brent crude <LCOc1> levelled off at $107.78 a barrel but that followed a drop of $2.98 on Thursday. U.S. crude <CLc1> was off 13 cents at $95.30, after shedding almost $5 the day before.     Gold was another beaten-down asset to get a reprieve, along with silver <XAG=> and platinum <XAG=>. Bullion had swung up to $1,230 <XAU=>, from as low as $1,183.80 early in the week.      Positive bullion prices in reaction to the decline in equities may set the tone for 2014 and reinforce the negative correlation between the two, HSBC analysts said in a note.

Movements in Eonia <EONIA=>, an average of interest rates at which euro zone banks lend to each other overnight, have been extraordinary this week by the standards of the money market, which usually rises and falls in tiny increments.     Eonia surged to a two-year high of 0.446 percent at the end of 2013 as thin liquidity forced banks to overpay for cash, before falling back to 0.152 percent when markets returned to normal.     Eonia traditionally rises sharply on the last trading day of each year when banks need to meet year-end cash targets and liquidity is thin. However, the 2013 peak was almost double the ECB's official refinancing rate of 0.25 percent at which it lends funds to the commercial banks.     This has raised worries that Eonia could trade much higher in 2014 than in past years, even though the ECB has flooded the banking system with cash to bring overnight rates to ultra low levels and help the euro zone recover from its debt crisis.     Higher money market rates effectively tighten the monetary conditions which the ECB loosened only in November when it cut the refinancing (refi) rate to its current record low. A prolonged rise in market rates could endanger the economic recovery, which, based on manufacturing surveys on Thursday and unemployment data on Friday, shows signs of picking up.     Stimulating economic growth is vital for the ECB's goal of avoiding a damaging bout of deflation and lifting inflation from a currently low level back towards its target of just below two percent. Stronger growth would also help countries  with lower credit ratings, such as Italy and Spain, to cut their overall debt and put the euro zone crisis to bed.     If Eonia holds around 0.15 percent, this should not create much discomfort for the ECB as it would lie roughly at the mid point between the refi rate and the deposit rate, at which banks park excess cash at the central bank overnight.     This would allow ECB policymakers to keep official rates unchanged when they meet next week, barring any sharp fall in  inflation when December data are released on Tuesday, analysts said. They're not going to jump the gun, said Harvinder Sian, rate strategist at RBS. But they probably won't be too tolerant of much higher levels.          SCRAMBLING FOR CASH     Eonia's year-end spike should still not be ignored, analysts said. In 2012, a rise to 0.13 percent was followed by a drop to 0.06 percent on Jan. 2, 2013, significantly lower levels than currently.     This is partly the result of banks repaying early some of the more than 1 trillion euros of three-year crisis loans offered by the ECB under its Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) at the height of the debt crisis in late 2011 and early 2012.     These repayments caused the excess cash in the banking system - money beyond what banks need for their day-by-day operations - to shrink from over 800 billion euros in March 2012 to about 275 billion euros at the end of last year.     Such repayments are expected to continue, and the less excess cash in the system, the higher the chances that banks may need to borrow more from other banks, pushing up money market rates.     The banks are now particularly keen to show they are less reliant on ECB loans and can raise more funding in the market. This is because the ECB is conducting an asset quality review (AQR) this year, part of a drive to check the health of euro zone lenders before it takes over supervising the most important banks from national bodies in late 2014.     Their wish to have more liquidity on their books for a year-end snapshot to be used in the review may have also contributed to the Eonia surge, some analysts said.     The AQR, the end-year effect and the repayment of LTRO money led to such a significant spike, Rabobank market economist Emile Cardon said.          DRAINING     Banks scrambling for cash meant that on Dec. 30 the ECB was  able to drain only 104.8 billion euros of the 178.5 billion it usually takes out of the system every week.      The draining operations aim to compensate for money the ECB pumped into the system under its Securities Markets Programme (SMP) when it began buying bonds on the debt market at the start of the crisis.      They were introduced to quell concerns, particularly in Germany, that the SMP would be inflationary and lead to the ECB directly financing government budget deficits, which it is forbidden from doing under European law. Draining operations are expected to resume in full in the next few weeks.     The relatively comfortable excess liquidity cushion might decrease when LTRO repayments pick up again and when the SMP absorption failure is taken away from the excess reserves, Commerzbank rate strategist Benjamin Schroeder said.     Schroeder expects market rates to rise again in 2014, although he does not believe the ECB will react to this as the economic recovery might withstand tighter monetary conditions. However, he says speculation about further ECB easing is likely to pick up later this year.     The ECB has a number of options, Sian at RBS said. It could cease withdrawing SMP money, halve the minimum level of liquid reserves that banks are required to hold - releasing 50 billion euros into the system - or provide more funding in the form of new LTROs with different features.

Full data is due later in the day.     Inflation in Germany at the last reading was 1.3 percent annually, below the ECB's target of close to but just below two percent in 2013. But it is expected to accelerate this year which could cause a policy headache for the ECB and its one-size-fits-all interest rate policy.     Other euro zone countries are contending with slowing inflation.     Two federal state reports on Monday showed a slight increase while a third was unchanged.     In North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state and traditionally a bellwether for the national data, the cost of living rose by 1.8 percent on the year in December, after gaining 1.6 percent in November. [ID:nL6N0KG0QL]     In Hesse, home to Germany's financial capital Frankfurt, annual inflation accelerated to 1.2 percent in December from 1.1 percent in the previous month, while it held steady at 1.4 percent in Saxony.     Pan-German consumer price inflation is seen speeding up to 1.4 percent on the year in December from the 1.3 percent in November, according to the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists. The data are due out at 1300 GMT.     As with bank lending and borrowing costs, inflation is highly fragmented across the euro zone.     Italy and Spain reported inflation rates of just 0.6 and 0.3 percent respectively last week while prices in Greece fell at a rate of 2.9 percent year-on-year at the last count.     The ECB cut rates to a record low after inflation in the euro zone eased to 0.7 percent in October. Several ECB policymakers have since then said there was no risk of deflation in the euro zone, but should it emerge they would still have options to address it.      But in Germany, which has outperformed peers throughout  much of the currency bloc's crisis, inflation is seen accelerating over the coming years.     The government said in October it saw consumer prices rising 1.8 percent in 2014 after gaining 1.5 percent in 2013. Next year, inflation could accelerate to 2.5 percent, the IfW think tank warned, saying low ECB interest rates could cause the economy to even overheat.     Markit's euro zone composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier on Monday, suggested however the gap between Germany and the rest of the currency bloc may be narrowing. [id:nL9E8E505B]     The survey showed businesses across the euro zone enjoyed a strong finish to 2013 as almost two years of job cuts came to an end last month. Moreover it suggested the region was on track to record modest economic growth in 2014.

South Africa, Turkey, India, Indonesia and Brazil earned the collective name after bearing the brunt of a sell-off provoked by a hint from the U.S. Federal Reserve at the end of May that it could start winding down its economic stimulus.     Measured in 12-month rolling terms, current account deficits widened in all the countries except India in the four quarters to September 2013, the following graphic, based on UBS data, shows:     http://link.reuters.com/zep75v     South Africa's deficit was 6.19 percent of annual economic output in the third quarter of 2013, almost a percentage point wider than in December 2012, while Turkey's widened slightly to 7.18 percent, the graphic shows.     On a seasonally-adjusted annual rate basis, South Africa's third quarter gap was even larger at 6.8 percent, official data showed last month.     Brazil's deficit widened by 1.2 percentage points to 3.6 percent, while Indonesia's increased by 0.8 points.     India's deficit, however, narrowed a percentage point to 4.35 percent in the July-September 2013 quarter, due to official curbs on gold imports.     To some extent the improvement in India is artificial but at the same time their export performance has also been very good, Christian Keller, Barclays' head of EEMEA research said.     The improved deficit and a flurry of reforms have helped the rupee <INR=> to recover more than 10 percent from record lows in August 2013, Keller noted. The rand, lira and rupiah, however, have continued to weaken <ZAR=> <TRY=> <IDR=>.

The ECB said no bonds matured last week.      The ECB terminated its Securities Markets Programme (SMP) in September 2012 to replace it with a new but yet-to-be used plan dubbed Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).     But because the ECB has said it will keep the bonds it acquired under the SMP programme until maturity, it will be years before the programme ceases to exist.     The ECB revealed the contents of its SMP portfolio for the first time in February last year, showing that it had 99 billion euros of Italian bonds, 44 billion of Spanish, 31 billion of Greek, 22 billion of Portuguese and 14 billion euros of Irish government debt at the end of last year.     The ECB will take an amount equivalent to the current SMP holdings as weekly deposits from banks on Tuesday to counterbalance the buys and neutralise any threat of them fuelling inflation.     It has failed to withdraw the full amount the past three times.

A Senate vote is set for 5:30 p.m. (2230 GMT) on Yellen, 67, who has been vice chair of the U.S. central bank since 2010.     If confirmed, Yellen would succeed Ben Bernanke, whose second four-year term ends on Jan. 31.     In an early sign that Yellen commands enough support to win confirmation, the Democratic-controlled Senate voted 59-34 on Dec. 20 to move forward with the nomination.     President Barack Obama's choice of Yellen put her in line to become the first female chief of the powerful U.S. central bank in its 100-year history and just one of a handful of women heading central banks globally.     Yellen has been an unwavering advocate of the Fed's aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy as it struggled to emerge from a severe economic recession.     In late 2008, the Fed cut overnight interest rates to near zero and has since conducted a series of massive bond purchase programs intended to keep long-term borrowing costs low.     The result has been a falling U.S. jobless rate, which hit a five-year low in November of 7 percent as the pace of economic growth has also picked up.     Assuming the Senate approves her nomination, Yellen's main task will be to navigate the central bank's way out of its extraordinary stimulus, dialing down its current bond-buying program. The U.S. central bank trimmed that program to $75 billion per month, from $85 billion, at a much anticipated policy meeting last month.     During a mid-November Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination, Yellen defended the Fed's aggressive actions to foster economic growth and said, I consider it imperative that we do what we can to promote a very strong recovery.     Some Republicans expressed concerns the Fed may have gone too far. I think the economy has gotten used to the sugar you've put out there and I just worry that we're on a sugar high, Senator Mike Johanns of Nebraska said at the time.

Plenty of other issues also will compete for attention. But with members of Congress jockeying for position in advance of the November elections, it will be difficult for them to avoid the partisanship that marked last year's session and find common ground to do much of anything in the new year. [ID:nL2N0KD0DE]     As a result, the Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives may be hard-pressed to do much beyond funding the government and raising the U.S. debt ceiling.     Here are the top issues facing Congress this year:                            YELLEN NOMINATION     Just hours after the Senate begins its work on Monday, it is expected to confirm Janet Yellen as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve. As vice chair since 2010, Yellen has been an unwavering advocate of the central bank's aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy. She will succeed Ben Bernanke, whose term comes to a close at the end of the month.          JOBLESS BENEFITS     Senate Democrats also kick off a bid on Monday to restore long-term jobless benefits for 1.3 million Americans. The benefits expired on Dec. 28 after efforts came up short to include them in a bipartisan, end-of-year budget deal. [ID:nL2N0KD0DE]     Many Republicans oppose an extension, arguing it would be a disincentive to find work. Democrats say relief is a moral imperative and would boost spending cuts elsewhere to help cover the cost.           GOVERNMENT FUNDING     Congress faces a Jan. 15 deadline to pass a massive appropriations bill to keep federal agencies operating. It is expected to do so largely because failure would set the stage for something neither party wants: a government shutdown.     The bipartisan budget deal enacted last month set overall spending levels for the rest of this fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, as well for the following year.     House and Senate aides are working to divide up $1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year, which will ease automatic across-the-board spending cuts.           DEBT CEILING     House Republicans and Senate Democrats are headed for another fight over the U.S. debt limit. President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats insist that the borrowing cap must be increased without new conditions being attached. Republicans have warned that they will be looking for something in return for adding to the $17.2 trillion national debt.     But there appears to be little appetite for going to the brink of a historic government default when Treasury Department borrowing authority runs out, possibly in early March.          MINIMUM WAGE     Democrats seem certain to fail in yet another major initiative - this one to increase the federal minimum wage. But they are expected to use the issue to rally their core supporters on election day. Polls show most Americans favor an increase in the minimum wage, which has stood at $7.25 an hour since July 2009.     Democrats say an increase is needed to help curb the growing gap between rich and poor. Republicans oppose an increase, saying it would cost jobs. A White House-backed bill would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour over three years and index it to inflation in the future.          IMMIGRATION     House Speaker John Boehner says he remains committed to revamping the nation's immigration laws, but whether he and his fellow Republicans will find enough support is unclear.     Boehner rejects the bipartisan comprehensive bill passed by the Senate last year and instead favors a step-by-step approach.     The biggest stumbling block appears to be the pathway to citizenship sought by the Senate for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. House Republicans call the pathway amnesty for lawbreakers.             TAX BREAKS     Almost 60 U.S. tax code provisions expired on Dec. 31. Known collectively as tax extenders, they include business tax breaks such as the research-and-development credit and bonus depreciation, as well as items for individuals, such as a deduction for qualified college tuition.     Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has introduced legislation to renew these tax breaks, but it has a long way to go through the legislative process.      MILITARY PENSIONS     Although Congress overwhelmingly approved a two-year budget deal, members of both parties want to revise a provision that would achieve $6 billion in savings over 10 years by trimming pension benefits for working-age military retirees.     Starting in 2015, these retirees under age 62 will see slightly lower cost-of-living adjustments and some critics complain the change would even apply to disabled veterans - something that congressional negotiators did not intend. Expect disabled vets to end up avoiding a cut.         OBAMACARE    Republicans are certain to keep pushing to repeal Obama's namesake healthcare program. But the president says that Obamacare will remain the law - at least while he is in the White House, where he can veto any legislation to kill it.     Meanwhile, the fumbled kickoff of Obamacare has prompted many frustrated Democrats to call for action to bolster the program and ease voter opposition. Backers note that an estimated 2 million people have signed up for the insurance. Yet that is 1 million short of what had been forecast by the end of 2013.                 IRAN SANCTIONS     Senate Democratic Leader Reid may defy a White House veto threat and call for a vote to impose new sanctions on Iran if talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program fail. The Senate vote could come as early as this month. Obama says threatening to toughen sanctions would be counterproductive at a time when his administration is working to improve relations with Iran, which have been very tense for more than 35 years.             PLASTIC GUNS     In response to a proliferation of plastic guns made with 3-D printers, a group of Democratic lawmakers supports a White House-backed push to update a 25-year-old law against guns that can pass undetected through metal detectors.     These members want all firearms to include at least a few ounces of non-removable metal that are essential to firing the weapon. The gun industry opposes such proposals, saying it would infringe on the right to bear arms.              DC CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS     U.S. District Court Judge Robert Wilkins appears certain to be confirmed by the Senate to a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is widely considered the nation's second most powerful court, behind only the U.S. Supreme Court. A vote is likely early this month.     Wilkins will be Obama's third nominee to the D.C. Circuit to be confirmed by the Senate within three months. All three were blocked last year, helping trigger a Senate rule change that stripped Republicans of their ability to stop most of Obama's nominees with a filibuster.

That matters far more to financial markets than to the real economy.     The big change is in the United States, which has now officially announced the first small step on the long journey from exceptional monetary policy to what was once considered normal. If all goes according to plan, January's small reduction of bond purchases will be the first of many. When the buying stops, the policy interest rate can start to increase, perhaps in 2015.      The two other major central banks are not moving away from exceptional policy. If anything, both the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan may have to offer additional stimulus. The euro zone's economic recovery is feeble at best and Japan's 2 percent inflation rate target still looks ambitious in a country where the last year that average cash earnings increased was 2005.     Divergence among the leading central banks has been rare in the globalised economy. Since the ECB started operation in 1999, its policy interest rates have moved only three times in a different direction from the Fed's, and each time the uniformity of direction was quickly restored. The Bank of Japan's rate, which has been below 1 percent since 1995, has also risen and fallen along with the global tides.     When monetary policy moves in different directions, there are some very profitable trades. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond has increased by 130 basis points since last May, almost twice as much as the increase on comparable German debt. The prospect of a more stimulative U.S. Federal Reserve capped a euro rally against the dollar in December.     Still, in terms of economic policy the big central banks are far more alike than different: they all remain highly stimulative. The United States is not abandoning monetary aggression, just diminishing it very slowly. Further, all leading central bankers agree that this will help increase GDP and employment.      While the timing of policy adjustments matters for financial markets, shock gyrations risk diverting attention from something more fundamental in the real economy. Monetary policy is exhausted. And five years of negative real interest rates - with no end in sight - might have weakened the overall system by making it dependent on cheap debt.               <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS:     www.breakingviews.com/TOPNewsSubscription          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>          CONTEXT NEWS     - The U.S. Federal Open Market Committee on Dec. 18 announced that it would reduce its monthly asset purchases by $10 billion, bringing them down to $75 billion.

Emerging economies might console themselves with that thought when they're suffering market cramps and haemorrhaging capital as the U.S. ends its monetary stimulus.      The Federal Reserve will begin winding down, or tapering, its $85 billion-a-month money-printing programme this month, and emerging markets are seeing foreign investment pull back as a result. Last year, around $30 billion fled emerging equity and bond funds tracked by EPFR Global, provisional data shows.     That is a blow, particularly for so-called deficit  countries such as India or Turkey, which rely on foreign inflows to plug balance-of-payment gaps. The hope is the volatility induced by tapering will prod governments into reforms that ultimately reduce their sensitivity to shifts in global capital.     Policymakers are under pressure to implement reforms that were put on the back burner. Tapering is at least getting that narrative going, said Manik Narain, a strategist at UBS. It's too early to position for it, but if we do get reform it could be the start of the rebirth of emerging markets.      The Fed's $3.7 trillion expansion of its balance sheet was a mixed blessing for developing countries. Economic growth was pumped up by record-low borrowing costs and hundreds of billions of dollars in stock and bond market investments.      But with so much easy money coming in, most governments got away with very little labour reform, privatisation, productivity gains or improvements to power and transport infrastructure. Progress in those areas will be key to attracting longer-term investment in manufacturing or services.          WHAT REFORM?     Past emerging-market crises - India in 1991, Mexico in 1994, Russia in 1998 and Turkey in 2001 - led to reforms that transformed those economies.         Mexico and India are ahead of the game this time. Punished by investors for messy politics and current account deficits, India has begun to shrink budget deficits, cut some subsidies and raise energy tariffs. Expectations of reform after the Indian elections due in mid-2014 have helped the rupee <INR=> rise 11 percent from record lows in mid-2013.      Energy-sector reform kept the Mexican peso's 2013 loss versus the dollar to 1.6 percent <MXN=>, compared with 10 percent-plus falls elsewhere in Latin America.     <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     For a story on deficit country elections, click [ID:nL6N0JY2AR]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>     But analysts say elections in a range of countries this year will discourage unpopular reforms for now. Any proposed changes in Russia or South Africa could be hampered by healthy prices for their oil and metals exports.     (The volatility) has spurred reform in some countries, but it's not EM-wide, that's for sure, said Christian Keller, head of EEMEA research at Barclays in London.     Capital Economics told clients that policymakers had an opportunity to undertake supply-side reform, but it feared that incumbent governments may try to boost re-election prospects by pushing ahead with populist spending plans, causing current account deficits to widen further.            'LET'S GET ON WITH IT'     Considering all that possibility and taking a longer-term view, a quick end to money printing is probably not a bad thing     Brazilian central bank governor Alexandre Tombini may have spoken for many emerging-market policymakers when he recently called U.S. policy normalisation a net positive. The sooner the Fed withdrew its stimulus, the better, he said.     That is unsurprising. The Fed's money printing gave central bankers headaches, by fuelling explosive spending and debt, property bubbles, price and currency inflation.     As domestic interest rates were cut to levels well below what was justified by fundamentals, current account gaps blew out. Brazil's deficit, for instance, is running at 3.5 percent of annual economic output, up from 1 percent in September 2009.     Policymakers are focusing on short-term volatility, which means they are too busy to focus on longer-term issues. The later the tapering the bigger the imbalances, said David Hauner, head of EEMEA fixed income strategy and economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.     As tapering progresses, markets will be able to better reward reformers and punish the laggards, by focusing more on country-specific factors, Hauner said, adding:     The best for emerging markets will be: 'let's get this done, have the U.S. Treasury yields repriced to 3.50 percent or so and let's move on'.

Asian shares had fallen to a three-week low after growth in China's services sector slowed sharply last month, and Tokyo's Nikkei <.N225> had endured a rocky first day of 2014 trading as the jitters prompted its biggest drop in over two-months.     European markets were digesting a raft of services sector data that shed additional light on the divergence between top economies Germany and France as well as the gradual recovery in Italy and Spain. [ID:nL9E8E505D][ID:nL9E8E5058][ID:nL9E8E5059]         The pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> had opened on the back foot following the difficult day in Asia and the data left London's FTSE <.FTSE>, Paris's CAC 40 <.FCHI> and Frankfurt's Dax <.GDAXI> down between 0.1 and 0.2 percent.         Safe-haven European bonds <DE10YT=TWEB> made early ground amid the uncertainty, while in the currency market the dollar hovered near a four-week high as it also benefited from Friday's upbeat view for the United States from Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke.     Philippe Gudin de Vallerin, head of European economics research at Barclays, said the euro zone PMI data underscored two trends going on in the region.          It has confirmed there is a growing divergence between Germany and France... And the second one is on Spain on Italy. There are some ups and down but more or less the trend is confirmed and the trend is an upward one.          CHINA        Concerns that China's powerhouse economy is slowing remained the main thorny issue for markets though after growth in its services sector slowed sharply in December to its lowest point since August 2011. [ID:nB9N0JK02G]     The figures followed a similar official survey on Friday and two other PMIs last week that showed factory activity also soured.         China's CSI300 share index <.CSI300> sagged 2.3 percent on Monday, hitting a five-month low and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> slid 0.8 percent to a three-week trough.     The Chinese index is now down 3.9 percent since the start of the year, adding to last year's 7.6 percent decline.      The focal point of the Asian markets is more on Chinese growth and on Chinese political situation and how it's going to pan out this year, rather than worrying about (U.S.) tapering, said Guy Stear, Asian credit and equity strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.     <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     Global services PMIs:       http://link.reuters.com/dyh85s     Asia manufacturing PMI:     http://link.reuters.com/maz35s     Thai baht:                  http://link.reuters.com/jev65v     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>      GOLD RUSH     The main beneficiary of the Asian tensions remained gold as it continued to rebound from last year's worst run in over three decades.     After the initial flurry of dealing in London it was sitting at $1,240 an ounce, it's highest in three weeks and on course for a fifth day of back-to-back gains.     Weaker equities will have more of an impact on gold prices than a stronger dollar, said Helen Lau, an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Securities in Hong Kong. It is all about allocation by funds.     On the opposite side of the China coin was the South Korean won <KRW=KFTC> as it hit a near six-week low. Ongoing political uncertainty in Thailand also left the baht <THB=TH> at a near four-year trough and Thai stocks <.SETI> at a 16-month low. [ID:nL3N0KF051]     With Japanese equities taking a beating, the yen got some respite against the dollar, up 0.3 percent at 104.55 yen <JPY=>, not far from a two-week high of 104.08 yen touched last Friday. The euro edged back above $1.36 <EUR=> after it had slumped to a five-week low.     Wednesday's December Fed meeting minutes and then Friday's non-farm payrolls data will give further clues on how quickly the Fed could unwind the stimulus that has been a major driver for global risk assets in the past few years.      With the Fed having set the tapering process in motion, it would likely take a fairly significant miss to derail tapering expectations and push yields significantly lower from their year-end levels, analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note.

After months of angst, investors will see how the U.S. Federal Reserve handles its decision to curtail its policy of easy money, starting from this month.     U.S. jobs data on Friday will give markets a sense of the pace at which the Fed plans to pare back its bond-buying programme, while minutes on Wednesday from its Dec. 18 meeting will throw light on the central bank's thinking.     The United States will be the main focus given the Fed has finally started to taper its asset purchases, said James Knightley, a senior economist at ING in London, referring to what economists call the tapering of U.S. stimulus.      Nonetheless, the Fed has made it clear that it will not be looking to run down the size of its balance sheet anytime soon, while rate hikes remain some way off, he said.     The Fed's stimulus revived the U.S. economy after the biggest crisis since the Great Depression and the U.S. economy is leading the global recovery. The United States could grow by up to 3 percent this year, helping the global economy to expand by almost 4 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.     The delicate job of bringing the $85 billion-a-month programme gradually to an end will almost certainly fall to Janet Yellen, whose candidacy as the next Fed chair will be voted on by the U.S. Senate on Monday. [ID:nL2N0KC16R]     Yellen, who would become the first woman to chair the U.S. central bank, would take the reins on Feb. 1, the day after Ben Bernanke ends his two-term stint.          CURRENCY CONCERNS     For emerging markets - major beneficiaries of cheap money unleashed by Fed stimulus - a scaling back of the programme will prompt investors to reduce their holdings of stocks and bonds. Short-term economic growth could suffer due to a failure to reform during the years of easy money.     Turkey is one country that relies on foreign capital to plug holes in its balance of payments and the country will be in focus again in the week ahead, not least because Ankara faces its greatest period of political instability in a decade.     Markets have calmed since the last week of 2013, when Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan dismissed police officers involved in a corruption investigation that has dragged in relatives of ministers and others with close links to the government.     But a falling lira is saddling companies with higher payments on foreign loans and pushing up inflation.     Indonesia, also vulnerable in the face of reduced U.S. stimulus due to its sizeable current account deficit, has been at the centre of the sell-off in emerging currencies and will hold a central bank policy meeting with the Fed firmly in mind.     Emerging markets are becoming more of a concern for the global economy as the rich world recovers from the 2008/2009 financial crisis, while China's slowing economy, which generates more than a third of global growth, has added to the unease.     The world's second-largest economy releases business surveys, trade, inflation and lending figures in the week ahead.           NO CELEBRATION     Europe offers good news for a change and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew should hear some of that in a visit to Berlin, Paris and Lisbon for talks with senior officials.      The single currency area is forecast to return to growth in 2014 after two years of contraction and Greece, at the centre of the bloc's crippling banking and debt crisis, expects its first economic expansion in six years.     Still, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be in no mood for celebrating when the bank's Governing Council meets on Thursday. He faces the difficult task of supporting growth with limited tools in a region still facing record unemployment and high public and private debt levels.     The ECB is banned from buying bonds directly from governments and cannot emulate the Fed, although it can find ways to purchase bonds from banks on the secondary market.     Draghi said last week he saw no need for immediate action after cutting interest rates to a record low of 0.25 percent in November, and sees signs of a gradual economic recovery.      Draghi will merely emphasise once again that the ECB is ready to act, said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.     Before the ECB meets, euro zone inflation data on Tuesday will show how consumer prices are holding up despite deflationary risks in some of the weaker economies.     Surveys of the euro zone's service sector are likely to show the currency bloc ended the year on a reasonably robust note, even if France's tepid performance is a concern. [ID:nL6N0KC1YK]     Outside the euro zone, Britain is in a different position, with growth picking up, unemployment falling and house prices rising, leading to talk of the need for a rate rise sooner rather than later to avoid a real estate bubble.     The Bank of England also holds its meeting on Thursday but no one expects a change in monetary policy this month. For the time being, the consensus remains that rates will rise from their record low of 0.5 percent in 2015.

Overall, the Fed's December senior credit officer opinion survey into dealer financing terms generally showed little changes in demand for funding compared to the previous three months.     But in a question on ETFs that invest in fixed-income assets, a third of dealers surveyed said their clients - including pension plans and endowments - had increased their use of the products somewhat over the past year.     Elsewhere in the survey, a third of dealers reported a decline over the past three months in financial leverage use by trading in real estate investment trusts, or REITs.      Twenty-two dealers were surveyed between Nov. 19 and Dec. 2. Those institutions account for almost all dealer financing of U.S. dollar-denominated provided to dealers, the Fed said.

Wrapping up a big economics conference in snow-swept Philadelphia, a handful of top U.S. central bankers were sometimes at odds over the ideal pace at which to wind down the purchases and, eventually, start to shrink the Fed's balance sheet and raise interest rates.     The Fed has held benchmark rates near zero since late 2008 to spur growth and hiring in the wake of the Great Recession. It has also quadrupled the size of its balance sheet to around $4 trillion through three rounds of massive bond purchases aimed at holding down longer-term borrowing costs.     In what came as a surprise to some, the Fed decided last month to cut its current quantitative easing program, or QE3, by $10 billion to $75 billion per month. It cited a stronger job market and economic growth in its landmark decision, which amounts to the beginning of the end of the largest monetary policy experiment ever. [ID:nW1N0IY00G]     Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren dissented against that decision. On Saturday he urged patience as the Fed continues to trim the purchases, in part because he said it risks a permanent rise in the number of Americans who are out of work.     The failure of monetary and fiscal policy to generate a more rapid recovery risks creating a long-term structural unemployment problem out of a severe cyclical downturn, the dovish Fed official said at the meeting of the American Economic Association.     U.S. unemployment has dropped from a post-recession high of 10 percent in 2009 to 7.0 percent in November, a five-year low. Still, the proportion of the unemployed who have been so for more than six months remains high, at almost 40 percent.     In what might be his last keynote speech as Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke told the conference on Friday that the economic recovery has a long way to go, and that the Fed is committed to stimulus as long as needed. Last month, he said the Fed plans to keep buying bonds through much of the year. [ID:nL2N0KD197]     Beyond that, the central bank has tried to telegraph its future intentions by saying it will most likely keep rates near zero well beyond the time joblessness falls below 6.5 percent.     Those promises make hawkish Fed officials like Charles Plosser uncomfortable. On Saturday Plosser, the head of the Philadelphia Fed, warned the recession could have done permanent damage to potential U.S. output.     Taking an indirect swipe at an approach favored by Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen, Plosser said he is skeptical of optimal control policy-making in which mathematical models are used to predict when things like unemployment and economic growth will return to more normal levels.     Measures that arbitrarily, or by assumption, assign the bulk of fluctuation in GDP to purely temporary factors may provide poor policy guidance when shocks are more permanent in nature, he said. [ID:L2N0KE0E4]     Yellen, who is set to take the reins at the U.S. central bank next month, has in the past suggested higher inflation could be tolerated for a short while in order to speed up the overall economic recovery.          LIFE AFTER BOND-BUYING     While gross domestic product growth rose above 4 percent in the third quarter, it has generally stayed closer to 2 percent since the recession ended in 2009, causing some to think that longer-term potential GDP growth is no longer the 3-percent rate to which Americans are accustomed. [ID:nL2N0IT28U]     If that is the case, the Fed's ultra-easy policy stance, including promises to keep rates near zero for a while to come in order to drive down joblessness, may be misdirected.     The shock that hit the economy appears to have had very persistent, if not permanent, effects, said Plosser, who regains a vote on policy this year under the Fed's rotating system. From a statistical perspective, the economy appears to have taken a permanent hit to the output level.     For now, the Fed is looking for sustainable economic growth and labor market improvement before it stops buying bonds and starts looking to shrink its balance sheet.     William Dudley, the influential head of the New York Fed, said he hopes the balance-sheet trimming will start to happen in the next four years - the duration of Yellen's term if she wins U.S. Senate approval as expected on Monday.     But there is a lot of uncertainty about how monetary policy exit will occur with the very large balance sheet, Dudley said. We have a pretty strong presumption that the instruments we have in place will work very well ... But there is no question that there could be unintended consequences.     Clearly communicating policy intentions becomes critically important in this phase because the real question is not what will happen today but what will happen in the future, he said.     Michael Woodford, a Columbia University professor whose writings on such communications have been hugely influential at the Fed and other central banks around the world, urged the Fed to further clarify exactly what economic conditions would cause it to consider raising rates.     I'm a little disappointed that ... they haven't been willing to tell us much more. They backed off somewhat, he told the conference on Friday, noting that 6.5 percent unemployment - the level the Fed has tied to a possible policy tightening - is not that far off.     One hopes that the new FOMC (the Fed's policy-making committee) will address this issue ... in coming months.

As their appetite for owning, buying and selling debt grows, that of Wall Street banks is shrinking.     Buying and selling bonds has never been as easy as it is for equities. But in the 2004 to 2007 boom, the liquidity gap closed somewhat. Investment banks more than doubled the dollar amount of corporate bonds they held on their balance sheets to $230 billion, according to New York Federal Reserve statistics. Bank of England data show corporate bond liquidity premiums were persistently below the historical average for most of 2003-2007.     That proved an anomaly. Banks' ensuing losses and new regulations from leverage ratio restrictions to the Volcker Rule obliterated that business model. By the end of March 2013, inventory had plummeted by three-quarters to just $56 billion, around 2002 levels. Yet assets held in high-grade and high-yield corporate bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have almost tripled over the past six years to $1.1 trillion, according to T. Rowe Price.     Wall Street firms say they are making up for lost balance-sheet capacity by turning over trading books more quickly. But that helps bondholders little, according to data from bond trading statistics provider Trace, cited in research by T. Rowe Price. Investment-grade block trades bigger than $5 million comprised 5 percent of the market before 2007; now it's less than 0.5 percent. Trades of $1 million or more have slipped to 2 percent from 20 percent.     Less liquidity means worse prices and a greater probability that herd-like investors sell at the first whiff of a crisis. That could come soon if the U.S. Federal Reserve starts dialling back its bond-buying program. The fact that many funds allow investors to withdraw cash at short notice means the market could be vulnerable if investors sell bonds en masse.     Bondholders can help themselves, by supporting nascent e-trading platforms - and not just ones that rely on combining a few brokers. The more comfortable investors get with putting their own data on such trading venues, the more overall liquidity should increase. And they could develop funds with longer liabilities to ease redemption pressures. If they sit on the sidelines, though, they will have to accept being stuck with bonds they no longer want.               <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^      SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS: www.breakingviews.com/TOPNewsSubscription             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>            - For previous columns, Reuters customers can click on [UNMACK/] and [CURRIE/]    (Editing by Antony Currie, John Foley and Martin Langfield)  ((neil.unmack@thomsonreuters.com)(antony.currie@thomsonreuters. com)(Reuters messaging)(neil.unmack.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)(antony.cu rrie.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))  Keywords: BREAKINGVIEWS BONDS/LIQUIDITY",20140106153221nL2N0KC0F3,nL2N0KC0F3

The surveys are likely to show the currency bloc ended the year on a reasonably robust note with Germany leading the way as always, Italy and Spain showing signs of life and France looking worryingly weak.     Ireland's reading is already out and has posted its fastest services growth in seven years. Much more importantly for the world, growth in China's services industries slowed in December, confirming that the world's second-largest economy lost steam at the end of last year.     German inflation on the EU-compatible HICP measure is forecast to have fallen to 1.4 percent year-on-year in December, from 1.6 in November, not the sort of move the ECB will like to see. We've already seen Italian and Spanish inflation come in at just 0.6 and 0.3 percent respectively.     A shock fall in euro zone inflation to 0.7 percent prompted an interest rate cut to 0.25 percent in November (not much scope to lower from there) followed by a chorus of denials that deflation was a threat.     ECB chief Mario Draghi adhered to that last week but added that he and his colleagues had to make sure inflation didn't get stuck in the danger zone below one percent.     By happy or unhappy coincidence, the latest inflation euro inflation data are due on Tuesday, two days before the ECB meets, and are forecast to show the rate unchanged at 0.9 percent.     It's too early for any dramatic moves but the ECB may well be pushed into easing policy if inflation refuses to pick up and/or the banks clam up ahead of this year's health tests.     We pretty much know the state of play within the ECB. With rates already close to zero, there will be no rush to cut them again, another gush of long-term cheap money for the banks is possible, particularly if the looming bank health tests cause them to tighten up further, but too many of its policymakers are viscerally opposed to printing money for that to become an option unless deflation seriously took hold.      U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will visit Berlin, Paris and Lisbon in the early part of the week. The agenda is not yet clear but the last time Lew was in Europe he was indirectly critical of Germany, stressing the need for Europe to boost domestic demand.     He also described banking union as crucial for the long-term stability of the euro zone. So his  views on whether the piecemeal agreement clinched in December is satisfactory to Washington is a key issue.     IMF chief Christine Lagarde is speaking in Kenya.     Britain's services PMI has reflected the strong growth (albeit from a low base) seen over the past six months. But finance minister George Osborne will don the hair shirt again today, saying that the job of fixing Britain's still wide budget deficit is far from done.     With one eye on next year's election he will say the way to cut taxes permanently is to cut spending permanently. The election timetable is starting to impose itself. Prime Minister David Cameron pledged on Sunday to protect pensioners' incomes, saying the state payment would rise annually by the rate of inflation, average wage increases or 2.5 percent, whichever was the higher.     Peace talks between South Sudan's government and rebels have barely got off the ground and the fighting continues. Three weeks of violence has killed more than a thousand people, forced a cut in oil output and left the world's newest state on the brink of civil war. Western powers are pressing for a deal. Sudanese President Bashir is due in Juba for talks with the south's President Kiir.     Turkish markets have settled after taking a hammering due to a wide-ranging corruption investigation which has led to the resignation of three members of the cabinet and highlighted concern about the independence of the judiciary.     Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan may have offered something of an olive branch, saying he would not oppose the retrial of hundreds of military officers convicted on coup plot charges. Turkey's appeals court in October upheld the convictions of top retired officers for leading a plot to overthrow Erdogan's government a decade ago.     Erdogan is flying to Japan to start an Asia tour which will also take in Singapore and Malaysia.

The consensus is that 2014 will be just as calm - a view held by some who were predicting the currency bloc's demise little more than a year ago.     The political will to keep the show on the road has held firm, the European Central Bank's pledge to underpin the euro continues to stave off bond market pressure and there is the prospect of economies growing at least a little.     Spain, Italy and Portugal are all emerging from recession  and Greece should follow suit this year.     Yet there are plenty of reasons to be cautious.          EU ELECTIONS     High unemployment, austerity fatigue and still anaemic growth offer the perfect backdrop for fringe parties to prosper at May's European parliamentary elections.     Some pundits predict a group of anti-euro parties including the National Front in France, Britain's UKIP, Syriza in Greece and the Dutch Freedom Party could capture 20 percent or more of the seats.     That could pressure the EU's main party groups to tack right and challenge Europe's ability to integrate further given new powers the parliament will have to rule on the majority of EU legislation.     It could pull mainstream parties into more eurosceptic positions and complicate both the appointment of a new European Commission (due later in the year) and the task of passing banking union-related legislation, said Alastair Newton, senior political analyst at Nomura Securities.          BANK STRESS     That the EU has fallen short of its initial plans for a banking union to prevent future financial crises is plain.     For several years at least, the buck for a failing bank will ultimately stop with national governments, leaving the  doom loop ensnaring weak banks and indebted sovereigns unbroken.     The ECB will publish health tests of Europe's biggest banks prior to taking over their supervision in November.     The scope for a major shock is limited given the extent to which banks have already recapitalised. Still, lending is likely to remain constrained until the tests are complete - hampering economic recovery - and the structure of banking union as it now exists could allow a future crisis to blow up.      GERMAN COURT     The main reason to be cheerful about the euro zone is the markets' unwillingness to test the ECB's safety net. Any hole in that would change the terms of the game at a stroke.     Germany's Constitutional Court will rule soon on the ECB's bond-buying programme, its as yet unused mechanism to protect the euro zone.     The history of the Karlsruhe-based court has not been to reject outright any crisis-fighting measures though it has bestowed greater levels of scrutiny upon Germany's Bundestag.     But if it did take the nuclear option, the bond market could declare open season on the currency bloc's weaker members once more, pushing it back into crisis.          REFORM ZEAL     The ECB has consistently said it is buying time for  countries to put their houses in order by curbing debts and enacting economic reforms needed to thrive in the 21st century.     The main flashpoints are Italy, which has stagnated for a decade and has a coalition government which may lack the cohesion to respond, and France which is teetering on the edge of a new recession.     France remains the only major European economy which is beset by serious health problems and has not yet done much about it, Berenberg Bank said in its annual review of the euro zone.     President Francois Hollande used his New Year address to offer companies lower labour taxes if they hire more workers. But with his popularity levels at record lows, a radical leap is unlikely.     Austerity fatigue is most potent in Greece, the country that sparked the debt crisis.     Its coalition government refuses to countenance more cuts and will need some form of debt relief to put its finances on a sustainable path at a time when its parliamentary majority is down to just three seats and the anti-bailout Syriza opposition  is ascendant in the polls.          DEFLATION     If deflation took hold - a big if - that would pose the direst threat of all, raising the prospect of a Japan-style lost decade and making national debts even harder to pay off.     A plunge in euro zone inflation to just 0.7 percent prompted the ECB to cut interest rates in November but many of its members are viscerally opposed to the sort of money printing that finally breathed life into Japan's economy.     We must take care that we don't have inflation stuck permanently below 1 percent and thereby slip into the danger zone, ECB chief Mario Draghi said last week.     Even without deflation, any slippage in debt-cutting and structural reforms may require further action from the ECB.     The history of the euro zone crisis shows that while policymakers lose their sense of urgency when the pressure diminishes, they rush to bolster their defences when the heat comes on and have consistently done so just in time.     2014 stands to be more challenging and dangerous for euro zone financial markets than the surprisingly calm 2013, said     Russell Jones, economist at Llewellyn Consulting in London.     (But) predictions of the euro area's imminent demise have proved systematically wide of the mark.

Plenty of other issues also will compete for attention. But with members of Congress jockeying for position in advance of the November elections, it will be difficult for them to avoid the partisanship that marked last year's session and find common ground to do much of anything in the new year. [ID:L2N0KD0DE]     As a result, the Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives may be hard-pressed to do much beyond funding the government and raising the U.S. debt ceiling.     Here are the top issues facing Congress this year:                            YELLEN NOMINATION     Just hours after the Senate begins its work on Monday, it is expected to confirm Janet Yellen as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve. As vice chair since 2010, Yellen has been an unwavering advocate of the central bank's aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy. She will succeed Ben Bernanke, whose term comes to a close at the end of the month.          JOBLESS BENEFITS     Senate Democrats also kick off a bid on Monday to restore long-term jobless benefits for 1.3 million Americans. The benefits expired on Dec. 28 after efforts came up short to include them in a bipartisan, end-of-year budget deal. [ID:nL2N0KD0DE]     Many Republicans oppose an extension, arguing it would be a disincentive to find work. Democrats say relief is a moral imperative and would boost spending cuts elsewhere to help cover the cost.           GOVERNMENT FUNDING     Congress faces a Jan. 15 deadline to pass a massive appropriations bill to keep federal agencies operating. It is expected to do so largely because failure would set the stage for something neither party wants: a government shutdown.     The bipartisan budget deal enacted last month set overall spending levels for the rest of this fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, as well for the following year.     House and Senate aides are working to divide up $1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year, which will ease automatic across-the-board spending cuts.           DEBT CEILING     House Republicans and Senate Democrats are headed for another fight over the U.S. debt limit. President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats insist that the borrowing cap must be increased without new conditions being attached. Republicans have warned that they will be looking for something in return for adding to the $17.2 trillion national debt.     But there appears to be little appetite for going to the brink of a historic government default when Treasury Department borrowing authority runs out, possibly in early March.          MINIMUM WAGE     Democrats seem certain to fail in yet another major initiative - this one to increase the federal minimum wage. But they are expected to use the issue to rally their core supporters on election day. Polls show most Americans favor an increase in the minimum wage, which has stood at $7.25 an hour since July 2009.     Democrats say an increase is needed to help curb the growing gap between rich and poor. Republicans oppose an increase, saying it would cost jobs. A White House-backed bill would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour over three years and index it to inflation in the future.          IMMIGRATION     House Speaker John Boehner says he remains committed to revamping the nation's immigration laws, but whether he and his fellow Republicans will find enough support is unclear.     Boehner rejects the bipartisan comprehensive bill passed by the Senate last year and instead favors a step-by-step approach.     The biggest stumbling block appears to be the pathway to citizenship sought by the Senate for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. House Republicans call the pathway amnesty for lawbreakers.             TAX BREAKS     Almost 60 U.S. tax code provisions expired on Dec. 31. Known collectively as tax extenders, they include business tax breaks such as the research-and-development credit and bonus depreciation, as well as items for individuals, such as a deduction for qualified college tuition.     Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has introduced legislation to renew these tax breaks, but it has a long way to go through the legislative process.      MILITARY PENSIONS     Although Congress overwhelmingly approved a two-year budget deal, members of both parties want to revise a provision that would achieve $6 billion in savings over 10 years by trimming pension benefits for working-age military retirees.     Starting in 2015, these retirees under age 62 will see slightly lower cost-of-living adjustments and some critics complain the change would even apply to disabled veterans - something that congressional negotiators did not intend. Expect disabled vets to end up avoiding a cut.         OBAMACARE    Republicans are certain to keep pushing to repeal Obama's namesake healthcare program. But the president says that Obamacare will remain the law - at least while he is in the White House, where he can veto any legislation to kill it.     Meanwhile, the fumbled kickoff of Obamacare has prompted many frustrated Democrats to call for action to bolster the program and ease voter opposition. Backers note that an estimated 2 million people have signed up for the insurance. Yet that is 1 million short of what had been forecast by the end of 2013.                 IRAN SANCTIONS     Senate Democratic Leader Reid may defy a White House veto threat and call for a vote to impose new sanctions on Iran if talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program fail. The Senate vote could come as early as this month. Obama says threatening to toughen sanctions would be counterproductive at a time when his administration is working to improve relations with Iran, which have been very tense for more than 35 years.             PLASTIC GUNS     In response to a proliferation of plastic guns made with 3-D printers, a group of Democratic lawmakers supports a White House-backed push to update a 25-year-old law against guns that can pass undetected through metal detectors.     These members want all firearms to include at least a few ounces of non-removable metal that are essential to firing the weapon. The gun industry opposes such proposals, saying it would infringe on the right to bear arms.              DC CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS     U.S. District Court Judge Robert Wilkins appears certain to be confirmed by the Senate to a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is widely considered the nation's second most powerful court, behind only the U.S. Supreme Court. A vote is likely early this month.     Wilkins will be Obama's third nominee to the D.C. Circuit to be confirmed by the Senate within three months.

After months of angst, investors will see how the U.S. Federal Reserve handles its decision to curtail its policy of easy money, starting from this month.     U.S. jobs data on Friday will give markets a sense of the pace at which the Fed plans to pare back its bond-buying programme, while minutes on Wednesday from its Dec. 18 meeting will throw light on the central bank's thinking.     The United States will be the main focus given the Fed has finally started to taper its asset purchases, said James Knightley, a senior economist at ING in London, referring to what economists call the tapering of U.S. stimulus.      Nonetheless, the Fed has made it clear that it will not be looking to run down the size of its balance sheet anytime soon, while rate hikes remain some way off, he said.     The Fed's stimulus revived the U.S. economy after the biggest crisis since the Great Depression and the U.S. economy is leading the global recovery. The United States could grow by up to 3 percent this year, helping the global economy to expand by almost 4 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund.     The delicate job of bringing the $85 billion-a-month programme gradually to an end will almost certainly fall to Janet Yellen, whose candidacy as the next Fed chair will be voted on by the U.S. Senate on Monday. [ID:nL2N0KC16R]     Yellen, who would become the first woman to chair the U.S. central bank, would take the reins on Feb. 1, the day after Ben Bernanke ends his two-term stint.          CURRENCY CONCERNS     For emerging markets - major beneficiaries of cheap money unleashed by Fed stimulus - a scaling back of the programme will prompt investors to reduce their holdings of stocks and bonds. Short-term economic growth could suffer due to a failure to reform during the years of easy money.     Turkey is one country that relies on foreign capital to plug holes in its balance of payments and the country will be in focus again in the week ahead, not least because Ankara faces its greatest period of political instability in a decade.     Markets have calmed since the last week of 2013, when Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan dismissed police officers involved in a corruption investigation that has dragged in relatives of ministers and others with close links to the government.     But a falling lira is saddling companies with higher payments on foreign loans and pushing up inflation.     Indonesia, also vulnerable in the face of reduced U.S. stimulus due to its sizeable current account deficit, has been at the centre of the sell-off in emerging currencies and will hold a central bank policy meeting with the Fed firmly in mind.     Emerging markets are becoming more of a concern for the global economy as the rich world recovers from the 2008/2009 financial crisis, while China's slowing economy, which generates more than a third of global growth, has added to the unease.     The world's second-largest economy releases business surveys, trade, inflation and lending figures in the week ahead.           NO CELEBRATION     Europe offers good news for a change and U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew should hear some of that in visits to Berlin, Paris and Lisbon for talks with senior officials.      The single currency area is forecast to return to growth in 2014 after two years of contraction. Greece, at the centre of the bloc's crippling banking and debt crisis, expects its first economic expansion in six years.     Still, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi will be in no mood for celebrating when the bank's Governing Council meets on Thursday. He faces the difficult task of supporting growth with limited tools in a region still facing record unemployment and high public and private debt levels.     The ECB is banned from buying bonds directly from governments and cannot emulate the Fed, although it can find ways to purchase bonds from banks on the secondary market.     Draghi said last week he saw no need for immediate action after cutting interest rates to a record low of 0.25 percent in November, and sees signs of a gradual economic recovery.      Draghi will merely emphasise once again that the ECB is ready to act, said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.     Before the ECB meets, euro zone inflation data on Tuesday will show how consumer prices are holding up despite deflationary risks in some of the weaker economies.     Surveys of the euro zone's service sector are likely to show the currency bloc ended the year on a reasonably robust note, even if France's tepid performance is a concern. [ID:nL6N0KC1YK]     Outside the euro zone, Britain is in a different position, with growth picking up, unemployment falling and house prices rising, leading to talk of the need for a rate rise sooner rather than later to avoid a real estate bubble.     The Bank of England also holds its meeting on Thursday but no one expects a change in monetary policy this month. For the time being, the consensus remains that rates will rise from their record low of 0.5 percent in 2015.

Economists said the slowdown was in part due to a change in methodology but the numbers may still add pressure on the European Central Bank to take some action to stave off any deflation threat.     The harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) - the measure of inflation used by the ECB - showed inflation slowing to 1.4 percent year-on-year in December, undershooting the consensus forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and down from 1.6 percent in November.     Both numbers are below the ECB's close-to-but-below 2.0 percent target.          Data due on Tuesday is forecast to show euro zone inflation steady at 0.9 percent in December for the second month. A drop to 0.7 percent in October prompted an interest rate cut.     Other euro zone countries are suffering from below target  price inflation.     The gap between Germany and the euro zone is no longer big enough to cause a policy headache for the ECB, said Holger Schmieding at Berenberg Bank, referring to the ECB's one-size-fits-all interest rate policy in view.     Schmieding and other economists pointed out that a change in the methodology of calculating holiday prices in Dec. 2012 had artificially boosted this rate since but had now dropped out of the annual comparison, allowing the year-on-year rate of HICP inflation to fall back to its underlying trend.     The HICP for the full-year 2013 decelerated to 1.6 percent from 2.1 percent in 2012. The statistics office said cheaper oil in the light of the weaker world economy had driven the deceleration in 2013 inflation.     Since the ECB cut rates to a record low in October, several ECB policymakers have said there is no risk of deflation in the euro zone, but should it emerge they would still have options to address it.     We are not seeing any deflation at present... but we must take care that we don't have inflation stuck permanently below one percent and thereby slip into the danger zone, ECB President Mario Draghi told a German magazine last month.     Dirk Schumacher at Goldman Sachs said the release of the German figure suggested euro zone inflation data later in the week  would show a slowdown to 0.8 percent.          ACCELERATING INFLATION IN 2014     However, in Germany, which has outperformed peers throughout  much of the currency bloc's crisis, inflation is seen accelerating over the coming years. Fragmented inflation across the euro zone could then become a policy headache for the ECB.     The German government said in October it saw consumer prices rising 1.8 percent in 2014. The IfW think tank says it could accelerate to 2.5 percent because low ECB interest rates could cause the economy to even overheat.     Consumer prices on a non-harmonised basis accelerated in line with expectations in December to 1.4 percent on the year from 1.3 percent in the previous month.     Italy and Spain reported inflation rates of just 0.6 and 0.3 percent respectively last week while prices in Greece fell at a rate of 2.9 percent year-on-year at the last count.     Markit's euro zone composite Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), released earlier on Monday, suggested however that the gap between Germany and the rest of the currency bloc may be narrowing.

European moves were far more muted, however, as a raft of data showing the divergence between top economies Germany and France, but also the gradual recoveries in Italy and Spain, cushioned the impact. [ID:nL9E8E505D][ID:nL9E8E5058][ID:nL9E8E5059]            Ahead of the start of U.S. trading, the pan-regional FTSEurofirst 300 <.FTEU3> had fought back to neutral territory as London's FTSE <.FTSE>, Paris's CAC 40 <.FCHI> and Frankfurt's Dax <.GDAXI> all recovered from early tumbles.     You could argue we have had some mixed news on the economic front, but I think in general the trend in the numbers is an improving one globally, said Robert Parkes, an equity strategist at HSBC.     The China is data is relevant but of course so are the euro zone PMIs that we have seen... We don't believe we are going to see a hard landing in China.     Despite the recovery in stocks there was still plenty of evidence of the caution the China data had fostered among investors.        Safe-haven European bonds <DE10YT=TWEB> were holding gains, copper <CMCU3> - highly-attuned to China's fortunes - remained firmly under pressure, while in the currency market the dollar <.DXY> hovered near a four-week high.              CHINA        The culprit for the moves was growth in the China's huge services sector which slowed sharply in December to its lowest point since August 2011. [ID:nB9N0JK02G]         The figures also came hot on the heels of a similar official survey on Friday and two other PMIs last week showing factory activity also soured.      China's CSI300 share index <.CSI300> sagged 2.3 percent, hitting a five-month low and MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> slid 0.8 percent to a three-week trough.     The Chinese index is now down 3.9 percent since the start of the year, adding to last year's 7.6 percent decline.      The focal point of the Asian markets is more on Chinese growth and on Chinese political situation and how it's going to pan out this year said Guy Stear, Asian credit and equity strategist at Societe Generale, as opposed to worries much of the world has about a reduction in U.S. central bank stimulus.            <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     Global services PMIs:       http://link.reuters.com/dyh85s     Asia manufacturing PMI:     http://link.reuters.com/maz35s     Thai baht:                  http://link.reuters.com/jev65v     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>      GOLD RUSH     The main beneficiary of the Asian tensions remained gold as it continued to rebound from last year's worst run in over three decades.     It was sitting at $1,238 an ounce as afternoon dealing gathered momentum in London, it's highest in three weeks and on course for a fifth day of back-to-back gains. Oil bounced too after four days of falls, with Brent at $107.76 a barrel.     Weaker equities will have more of an impact on gold prices than a stronger dollar, said Helen Lau, an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian Securities in Hong Kong. It is all about allocation by funds.     On the opposite side of the China coin was the South Korean won <KRW=KFTC> as it hit a near six-week low. Ongoing political uncertainty in Thailand also left the baht <THB=TH> at a near four-year trough and Thai stocks <.SETI> at a 16-month low. [ID:nL3N0KF051]     With Japanese equities taking a beating, the yen got some respite against the dollar, up 0.3 percent at 104.55 yen <JPY=>.

They should give further clues on how quickly the Fed is likely to wind in its huge stimulus programme in the coming months.     With the Fed having set the tapering process in motion, it would likely take a fairly significant miss to derail tapering expectations and push yields significantly lower from their year-end levels, analysts at BNP Paribas wrote in a note.

Portfolio managers at large U.S. bond funds are, however, a bit optimistic. They say the most violent adjustment in the bond market has already happened, even though bond yields should rise a little more in 2014 as the Federal Reserve reduces its massive stimulus program.     Some analysts have long foreseen a protracted rise in yields after nearly 30 years of steadily falling rates. But the consensus among managers is that benchmark 10-year Treasury yields should peak around 3.5 percent this year, up from 3 percent now and remain otherwise in a tight range. A 50-basis point rise would pale against the 125 basis-point rise in yields in 2013.    We don't expect another aggressive bond sell-off. I think even with the Fed tapering, policy accommodation will remain pretty high in 2014, said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed-income research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Portland, Oregon.     Another surge in yields would mean more misery for bond investors, including Bill Gross, who runs the world's biggest bond fund, the Pimco Total Return Fund <PTTRX.O>. That fund suffered its first annual loss since 1999, a negative return of nearly 2 percent. [ID:nL2N0KC0HX]     But if the rise in yields is moderate and orderly, Gross and other investors who are bullish on Treasuries would have plenty of time to adjust their portfolios to reduce losses and take on bets in other bond sectors.     Fund flows into Treasuries in 2013 were slower than any other year since 2000. Pension funds, insurance companies, college endowments and foreign investors could find greater appeal in Treasuries as yields edge higher in coming months, but retail investors might still shy away from bond funds, particularly given the buoyant outlook for equities.     Any zig-zag in rates will have retail investors very nervous, said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey, which oversees $1 trillion in assets.     The yield on 10-year Treasury notes <US10YT=RR> was 2.99 percent on Friday, roughly a two-and-a-half-year high and nearly double what it was a year ago. Increases in yields accelerated in May, after Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke suggested before a congressional panel that the Fed might consider shrinking its quantitative easing before year-end. [US/]     Recent data has supported the view of a somewhat slow-growing U.S. economy, which will likely keep the Fed tapering gradually and cautious about raising interest rates.     What the market is adjusting to is a little faster growth and less Fed buying. It could be another year of negative returns, said Gemma Wright-Casparius, portfolio manager at Vanguard, the top U.S. mutual fund company.     The 10-year yield has stabilized above 3 percent as investors await the payrolls report for December to determine if the economy is strong enough for Fed to quicken its stimulus reduction and possibly raise rates before late 2015.     On Friday, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said if the economy strengthens more than expected this year, he could see the Fed increasing rates in later 2014.  [ID:nL2N0KD1AA]      With blue chip stocks powering into record territory, investors have been moving away from bond funds since June. Still, bond funds were able to report $29 billion in inflows in 2013, although they were the weakest since 2000, according to Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters. [ID:nL2N0KC1AE]     In fresh quarterly forecasts released last month, the Fed's outlook on growth of gross domestic product was in a range of 2.8 percent to 3.2 percent in 2014, a tad stronger than what Wall Street expects. [ID:nW1E7N901O]     There's a fair amount of economic optimism priced into these yields, said Bill Irving, a Merrimack, New Hampshire portfolio manager for Fidelity Investments, the No. 2 U.S. mutual fund company. I don't see the 10-year yield going much higher from here. We have to see more surprisingly strong data.     The threat to this view of a moderate yield rise would come if growth, perhaps driven by the U.S. energy production boom and the impact of higher home and stock prices on consumer spending, were to rise to 3.5 percent to 4.0 percent. That would in turn put pressure on the Fed to pull back on its bond buying more quickly and lead to concerns that the Fed would raise short-term interest rates sooner than the late 2015 currently expected. All that could force bond yields significantly higher than 3.5 percent.     Since the Fed began purchasing Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, its balance sheet has ballooned by more than $1 trillion to near $4 trillion since late 2012.     On Dec. 18, Fed policymakers said the U.S. central bank will purchase $75 billion in bonds in January, $10 billion less than the monthly pace at which it had been buying.   <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Graphics:  Fed trims its bond buying   http://link.reuters.com/myp55v  When Fed tighten policy?    http://link.reuters.com/sup55v  U.S. bond fund flows        http://link.reuters.com/vup75v  U.S. Treasury yields        http://link.reuters.com/gar98t  U.S. Treasury yield spreads http://link.reuters.com/kar98t  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>             BOND BEARS COMETH?     A lousy year for Treasuries is rare. Even including a dismal 2013, the Treasuries market has posted annual losses only four times since 1973, according to Barclays, and has never experienced back-to-back losing years.      In 2013, Treasuries suffered a 2.75 percent loss, while the broader U.S. bond market declined 2.02 percent, the biggest annual drop since 1994, according to indexes that Barclays compiles.     The biggest yearly rise in benchmark Treasuries yields in four years disrupted the housing market this past summer, but it has proven to be only a hiccup for the economy.     U.S. growth had recorded its best three months in nearly two years this autumn, while Wall Street booked its biggest annual gain in more than 15 years.

Plenty of other issues also will compete for attention. But with members of Congress jockeying for position in advance of the November elections, it will be difficult for them to avoid the partisanship that marked last year's session and find common ground to do much of anything in the new year. [ID:nL2N0KD0DE]     As a result, the Democrat-controlled Senate and Republican-controlled House of Representatives may be hard-pressed to do much beyond funding the government and raising the U.S. debt ceiling.     Here are the top issues facing Congress this year:                            YELLEN NOMINATION     Just hours after the Senate begins its work on Monday, it is expected to confirm Janet Yellen as the first woman chair of the Federal Reserve. As vice chair since 2010, Yellen has been an unwavering advocate of the central bank's aggressive steps to boost the U.S. economy. She will succeed Ben Bernanke, whose term comes to a close at the end of the month.          JOBLESS BENEFITS     Senate Democrats also kick off a bid on Monday to restore long-term jobless benefits for 1.3 million Americans. The benefits expired on Dec. 28 after efforts came up short to include them in a bipartisan, end-of-year budget deal. [ID:nL2N0KD0DE]     Many Republicans oppose an extension, arguing it would be a disincentive to find work. Democrats say relief is a moral imperative and would boost spending cuts elsewhere to help cover the cost.           GOVERNMENT FUNDING     Congress faces a Jan. 15 deadline to pass a massive appropriations bill to keep federal agencies operating. It is expected to do so largely because failure would set the stage for something neither party wants: a government shutdown.     The bipartisan budget deal enacted last month set overall spending levels for the rest of this fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, as well for the following year.     House and Senate aides are working to divide up $1.012 trillion for the current fiscal year, which will ease automatic across-the-board spending cuts.           DEBT CEILING     House Republicans and Senate Democrats are headed for another fight over the U.S. debt limit. President Barack Obama and his fellow Democrats insist that the borrowing cap must be increased without new conditions being attached. Republicans have warned that they will be looking for something in return for adding to the $17.2 trillion national debt.     But there appears to be little appetite for going to the brink of a historic government default when Treasury Department borrowing authority runs out, possibly in early March.          MINIMUM WAGE     Democrats seem certain to fail in yet another major initiative - this one to increase the federal minimum wage. But they are expected to use the issue to rally their core supporters on election day. Polls show most Americans favor an increase in the minimum wage, which has stood at $7.25 an hour since July 2009.     Democrats say an increase is needed to help curb the growing gap between rich and poor. Republicans oppose an increase, saying it would cost jobs. A White House-backed bill would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour over three years and index it to inflation in the future.          IMMIGRATION     House Speaker John Boehner says he remains committed to revamping the nation's immigration laws, but whether he and his fellow Republicans will find enough support is unclear.     Boehner rejects the bipartisan comprehensive bill passed by the Senate last year and instead favors a step-by-step approach.     The biggest stumbling block appears to be the pathway to citizenship sought by the Senate for an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. House Republicans call the pathway amnesty for lawbreakers.             TAX BREAKS     Almost 60 U.S. tax code provisions expired on Dec. 31. Known collectively as tax extenders, they include business tax breaks such as the research-and-development credit and bonus depreciation, as well as items for individuals, such as a deduction for qualified college tuition.     Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid has introduced legislation to renew these tax breaks, but it has a long way to go through the legislative process.      MILITARY PENSIONS     Although Congress overwhelmingly approved a two-year budget deal, members of both parties want to revise a provision that would achieve $6 billion in savings over 10 years by trimming pension benefits for working-age military retirees.     Starting in 2015, these retirees under age 62 will see slightly lower cost-of-living adjustments and some critics complain the change would even apply to disabled veterans - something that congressional negotiators did not intend. Expect disabled vets to end up avoiding a cut.         OBAMACARE    Republicans are certain to keep pushing to repeal Obama's namesake healthcare program. But the president says that Obamacare will remain the law - at least while he is in the White House, where he can veto any legislation to kill it.     Meanwhile, the fumbled kickoff of Obamacare has prompted many frustrated Democrats to call for action to bolster the program and ease voter opposition. Backers note that an estimated 2 million people have signed up for the insurance. Yet that is 1 million short of what had been forecast by the end of 2013.                 IRAN SANCTIONS     Senate Democratic Leader Reid may defy a White House veto threat and call for a vote to impose new sanctions on Iran if talks aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear program fail. The Senate vote could come as early as this month. Obama says threatening to toughen sanctions would be counterproductive at a time when his administration is working to improve relations with Iran, which have been very tense for more than 35 years.             PLASTIC GUNS     In response to a proliferation of plastic guns made with 3-D printers, a group of Democratic lawmakers supports a White House-backed push to update a 25-year-old law against guns that can pass undetected through metal detectors.     These members want all firearms to include at least a few ounces of non-removable metal that are essential to firing the weapon. The gun industry opposes such proposals, saying it would infringe on the right to bear arms.              DC CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS     U.S. District Court Judge Robert Wilkins appears certain to be confirmed by the Senate to a seat on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is widely considered the nation's second most powerful court, behind only the U.S. Supreme Court. A vote is likely early this month.     Wilkins will be Obama's third nominee to the D.C. Circuit to be confirmed by the Senate within three months. All three were blocked last year, helping trigger a Senate rule change that stripped Republicans of their ability to stop most of Obama's nominees with a filibuster.

Emerging economies might console themselves with that thought when they're suffering market cramps and haemorrhaging capital as the U.S. ends its monetary stimulus.      The Federal Reserve will begin winding down, or tapering, its $85 billion-a-month money-printing programme this month, and emerging markets are seeing foreign investment pull back as a result. Last year, around $30 billion fled emerging equity and bond funds tracked by EPFR Global, provisional data shows.     That is a blow, particularly for so-called deficit  countries such as India or Turkey, which rely on foreign inflows to plug balance-of-payment gaps. The hope is the volatility induced by tapering will prod governments into reforms that ultimately reduce their sensitivity to shifts in global capital.     Policymakers are under pressure to implement reforms that were put on the back burner. Tapering is at least getting that narrative going, said Manik Narain, a strategist at UBS. It's too early to position for it, but if we do get reform it could be the start of the rebirth of emerging markets.      The Fed's $3.7 trillion expansion of its balance sheet was a mixed blessing for developing countries. Economic growth was pumped up by record-low borrowing costs and hundreds of billions of dollars in stock and bond market investments.      But with so much easy money coming in, most governments got away with very little labour reform, privatisation, productivity gains or improvements to power and transport infrastructure. Progress in those areas will be key to attracting longer-term investment in manufacturing or services.          WHAT REFORM?     Past emerging-market crises - India in 1991, Mexico in 1994, Russia in 1998 and Turkey in 2001 - led to reforms that transformed those economies.         Mexico and India are ahead of the game this time. Punished by investors for messy politics and current account deficits, India has begun to shrink budget deficits, cut some subsidies and raise energy tariffs. Expectations of reform after the Indian elections due in mid-2014 have helped the rupee <INR=> rise 11 percent from record lows in mid-2013.      Energy-sector reform kept the Mexican peso's 2013 loss versus the dollar to 1.6 percent <MXN=>, compared with 10 percent-plus falls elsewhere in Latin America.     <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     For a story on deficit country elections, click [ID:nL6N0JY2AR]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>     But analysts say elections in a range of countries this year will discourage unpopular reforms for now. Any proposed changes in Russia or South Africa could be hampered by healthy prices for their oil and metals exports.     (The volatility) has spurred reform in some countries, but it's not EM-wide, that's for sure, said Christian Keller, head of EEMEA research at Barclays in London.     Capital Economics told clients that policymakers had an opportunity to undertake supply-side reform, but it feared that incumbent governments may try to boost re-election prospects by pushing ahead with populist spending plans, causing current account deficits to widen further.            'LET'S GET ON WITH IT'     Considering all that possibility and taking a longer-term view, a quick end to money printing is probably not a bad thing     Brazilian central bank governor Alexandre Tombini may have spoken for many emerging-market policymakers when he recently called U.S. policy normalisation a net positive. The sooner the Fed withdrew its stimulus, the better, he said.     That is unsurprising. The Fed's money printing gave central bankers headaches, by fuelling explosive spending and debt, property bubbles, price and currency inflation.     As domestic interest rates were cut to levels well below what was justified by fundamentals, current account gaps blew out. Brazil's deficit, for instance, is running at 3.5 percent of annual economic output, up from 1 percent in September 2009.     Policymakers are focusing on short-term volatility, which means they are too busy to focus on longer-term issues. The later the tapering the bigger the imbalances, said David Hauner, head of EEMEA fixed income strategy and economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.     As tapering progresses, markets will be able to better reward reformers and punish the laggards, by focusing more on country-specific factors, Hauner said, adding:     The best for emerging markets will be: 'let's get this done, have the U.S. Treasury yields repriced to 3.50 percent or so and let's move on'.

She will succeed Ben Bernanke when his term expires on Jan. 31.     Following are five key facts about Yellen, who is currently the vice chair at the central bank:          - Yellen, 67, would be the first woman to head the Fed and one of the few to lead a central bank of a major economy.     - She is seen as a dove on monetary policy, favoring strategies that bring down unemployment even at the risk of driving inflation higher. When the goals conflict and it comes to calling for tough trade-offs, to me, a wise and humane policy is occasionally to let inflation rise even when inflation is running above target, Yellen said in 1995.     - She has extensive policymaking experience. Before her appointment as Fed vice chair in 2010, Yellen took part in U.S. monetary policymaking as president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank from 2004 to 2010, and as a governor on the Fed board from 1994 to 1997. She also chaired President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers from 1997 to 1999.      - Yellen is a widely respected economist. With a PhD from Yale, she has taught economics at the University of California, Berkeley, Harvard University and the London School of Economics (LSE). She has published research on topics as disparate as youth gangs, single mothers, optimal monetary policy, wage and price rigidity, and trade.     - Economics saturates her personal life as well. She is married to, and has co-authored a number of papers with, Nobel Prize-winning economist George Akerlof, whom she met in 1977 when they were both economists at the Fed board. They married the following June and left the Fed to teach at LSE. Their only child, now a university economics professor, knew he wanted to go into economics by the time he was 13.

The report, released on Monday, analyzed more than 20 years of data and found that, while it generally takes new graduates some time to transition into the job market, today's graduates are having an even tougher time and many are accepting jobs for which they are overqualified, low-wage jobs or part-time work.     It is not clear whether these trends represent a structural change in the labor market, or if they are a consequence of the two recessions and jobless recoveries in the first decade of the 2000s, the report said.     The study was conducted by Richard Deitz, an assistant vice president in the New York Fed's Research and Statistics Group, and Jaison Abel, a senior economist in the group.     Even though overall U.S. unemployment has declined, falling to a five-year low of 7 percent in November, young graduates are entering an economy that is still fragile and far from its pre-recession levels.     The report found that graduates from fields that provided technical skills or serve growing parts of the U.S. economy fared better.     Healthcare and education graduates had lower unemployment rates of about 3 percent and 4 percent respectively, while construction and architecture majors and liberal arts and social sciences majors experienced the highest levels of unemployment of 7 percent to 8 percent.      The authors said this trend of higher unemployment for new graduates began with the 2001 recession, improved when the economy recovered, and deteriorated again during the most recent economic downturn.      Problems facing new graduates are compounded because more students graduate with massive amounts of debt due to spiraling costs for higher education. About 70 percent of U.S. students who graduated in 2012 had student loan debt, with the average borrower owing $29,400, up from $26,000 the previous year.     The underemployment rate for recent graduates is also higher than in the previous two decades. That rate was 34 percent in 2001. By 2012, it had risen to 44 percent. Because of the scarcity of jobs, recent graduates have tended to take low-paying jobs or jobs that don't require a college degree such as positions as bartenders or retail clerks.     However, the authors of the report say the relatively high unemployment experienced by recent college graduates is no reason to dismiss the value of a college education.     The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects faster growth for jobs that require at least post-secondary education by 2022. Workers with a post-secondary education or more earned a median of $57,770 in 2012 compared with $27,670 for jobs requiring a high school diploma.

Movements in Eonia <EONIA=>, an average of interest rates at which euro zone banks lend to each other overnight, have been extraordinary this week by the standards of the money market, which usually rises and falls in tiny increments.     Eonia surged to a two-year high of 0.446 percent at the end of 2013 as thin liquidity forced banks to overpay for cash, before falling back to 0.152 percent when markets returned to normal.     Eonia traditionally rises sharply on the last trading day of each year when banks need to meet year-end cash targets and liquidity is thin. However, the 2013 peak was almost double the ECB's official refinancing rate of 0.25 percent at which it lends funds to the commercial banks.     This has raised worries that Eonia could trade much higher in 2014 than in past years, even though the ECB has flooded the banking system with cash to bring overnight rates to ultra low levels and help the euro zone recover from its debt crisis.     Higher money market rates effectively tighten the monetary conditions which the ECB loosened only in November when it cut the refinancing (refi) rate to its current record low. A prolonged rise in market rates could endanger the economic recovery, which, based on manufacturing surveys on Thursday and unemployment data on Friday, shows signs of picking up.     Stimulating economic growth is vital for the ECB's goal of avoiding a damaging bout of deflation and lifting inflation from a currently low level back towards its target of just below two percent. Stronger growth would also help countries  with lower credit ratings, such as Italy and Spain, to cut their overall debt and put the euro zone crisis to bed.     If Eonia holds around 0.15 percent, this should not create much discomfort for the ECB as it would lie roughly at the mid point between the refi rate and the deposit rate, at which banks park excess cash at the central bank overnight.     This would allow ECB policymakers to keep official rates unchanged when they meet next week, barring any sharp fall in  inflation when December data are released on Tuesday, analysts said. They're not going to jump the gun, said Harvinder Sian, rate strategist at RBS. But they probably won't be too tolerant of much higher levels.          SCRAMBLING FOR CASH     Eonia's year-end spike should still not be ignored, analysts said. In 2012, a rise to 0.13 percent was followed by a drop to 0.06 percent on Jan. 2, 2013, significantly lower levels than currently.     This is partly the result of banks repaying early some of the more than 1 trillion euros of three-year crisis loans offered by the ECB under its Long Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) at the height of the debt crisis in late 2011 and early 2012.     These repayments caused the excess cash in the banking system - money beyond what banks need for their day-by-day operations - to shrink from over 800 billion euros in March 2012 to about 275 billion euros at the end of last year.     Such repayments are expected to continue, and the less excess cash in the system, the higher the chances that banks may need to borrow more from other banks, pushing up money market rates.     The banks are now particularly keen to show they are less reliant on ECB loans and can raise more funding in the market. This is because the ECB is conducting an asset quality review (AQR) this year, part of a drive to check the health of euro zone lenders before it takes over supervising the most important banks from national bodies in late 2014.     Their wish to have more liquidity on their books for a year-end snapshot to be used in the review may have also contributed to the Eonia surge, some analysts said.     The AQR, the end-year effect and the repayment of LTRO money led to such a significant spike, Rabobank market economist Emile Cardon said.          DRAINING     Banks scrambling for cash meant that on Dec. 30 the ECB was  able to drain only 104.8 billion euros of the 178.5 billion it usually takes out of the system every week.      The draining operations aim to compensate for money the ECB pumped into the system under its Securities Markets Programme (SMP) when it began buying bonds on the debt market at the start of the crisis.      They were introduced to quell concerns, particularly in Germany, that the SMP would be inflationary and lead to the ECB directly financing government budget deficits, which it is forbidden from doing under European law. Draining operations are expected to resume in full in the next few weeks.     The relatively comfortable excess liquidity cushion might decrease when LTRO repayments pick up again and when the SMP absorption failure is taken away from the excess reserves, Commerzbank rate strategist Benjamin Schroeder said.     Schroeder expects market rates to rise again in 2014, although he does not believe the ECB will react to this as the economic recovery might withstand tighter monetary conditions. However, he says speculation about further ECB easing is likely to pick up later this year.     The ECB has a number of options, Sian at RBS said. It could cease withdrawing SMP money, halve the minimum level of liquid reserves that banks are required to hold - releasing 50 billion euros into the system - or provide more funding in the form of new LTROs with different features.

When Yellen, an accomplished economist and the Fed's current vice chair, takes the reins on Feb. 1 she will face a series of delicate policy challenges, starting with how quickly to wind down the Fed's aggressive bond-buying campaign.     Here are the main challenges on the horizon:          BLOATED BALANCE SHEET     After three rounds of quantitative easing, or QE, the Fed's balance sheet has swelled to about $4 trillion, a record level and far higher than the approximately $1 trillion the Fed has carried in more normal times.     Some fear the money the Fed created to purchase this haul of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities with the aim of encouraging investment, hiring and economic growth could stoke inflation in the years ahead, and potentially cause hard-to-detect market disruptions and asset bubbles.     The Fed announced on Dec. 18 that it would modestly trim the pace of its monthly bond purchases to $75 billion in January from $85 billion. But it remains keen to keep borrowing costs low by convincing investors that interest rates will not rise for a while longer.      The trick for Yellen will be winding down QE without rattling financial markets or disrupting an economic recovery that has proven vulnerable to domestic and foreign shocks.          LIFTOFF FOR INTEREST RATES     The Fed's main policy tool, the overnight federal funds rate, has been near zero since the darkest days of the financial crisis in late 2008. The first increase is not likely to come until 2015, based on Fed predictions, though that could change if inflation or unemployment veer away from expectations.     The central bank had said it would keep rates where they are at least until unemployment dropped to 6.5 percent, as long as inflation did not threaten to top 2.5 percent.     It tweaked that pledge on Dec. 18, saying it likely would be appropriate to keep rates near zero well past the time that the jobless rate fell below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation expectations remained below target. The jobless rate stood at 7.0 percent in November.     But financial markets at times have questioned the credibility of the Fed's policy promises. If investors start to expect rates will rise earlier than the Fed intends, borrowing costs could start to rise and trip up the economy.     Some officials want to lower the jobless rate threshold to underscore the Fed's commitment to keep borrowing costs low.     Yellen will now have to take the lead role in guiding expectations.          UNEMPLOYMENT, INFLATION (AND DISINFLATION)     Right now, everyone agrees that unemployment is too high and inflation too low, so the Fed has faced a relatively easy decision on keeping monetary policy very loose.     But inflation is running well below target. If it does not start to pick up, policymakers will face the difficult question of whether to ramp up their already extraordinary stimulus to stave off deflation.     On the other hand, if inflation perks up and threatens to reach the Fed's 2.5 percent upper threshold, policymakers might be forced to tighten policy despite higher-than-desired joblessness.      Possibly complicating things, the Fed will for the first time be able to also raise the interest rate it pays banks on the excess reserves they hold at the central bank. Doing so should stem what could otherwise be a flood of bank reserves into the marketplace that could threaten to overheat the economy - but it is an untested tool.          LONGER-TERM EXIT STRATEGY     Further out on the horizon, the central bank will have to shrink its balance sheet to a more normal size, whether by letting the bonds it holds mature or selling them outright. The quicker it reduces holdings, the tighter monetary policy will become and the greater the pressure on markets to absorb the assets.     But perhaps most sensitive for the Fed, selling bonds could give rise to losses that would lead to a temporary end to its regular remittances to the U.S. Treasury, potentially opening the door to action by politicians who want to rein in the central bank's prized independence.

Germany's HICP rate fell to 1.2 percent last month, Italy's hit 0.6 percent and Spain's just 0.3 percent in December (not to mention Greece's -2.9 percent).     Today we get the figure for the euro zone as a whole. Forecasts for it to hold at 0.9 percent may now look a little toppy.     It's too early for any dramatic moves but the European Central Bank, which has a policy meeting on Thursday, may well be pushed into easing policy if inflation refuses to pick up and/or the banks clam up ahead of this year's health tests.     A shock fall in euro inflation to 0.7 percent prompted an interest rate cut to 0.25 percent in November followed by a chorus of denials that deflation was a threat. ECB chief Mario Draghi adhered to that last week but added that he and his colleagues had to make sure inflation didn't get stuck in the danger zone below one percent.     We pretty much know the state of play, although that does not disguise the differing camps within the Governing Council.     With rates already close to zero, there will be no rush to cut them again. Another gush of long-term cheap money for the banks is possible, particularly if the looming bank health tests cause them to tighten up on lending further, but too many ECB policymakers are viscerally opposed to printing money for that to become an option unless deflation seriously took hold.      U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will visit Paris, Berlin and Lisbon over the next two days. The last time Lew was in Europe he was indirectly critical of Germany, stressing the need for Europe to boost domestic demand. If deflation looks like becoming a threat, the imperative to boost economic activity will come into even more sharp relief.     Lew also described banking union as crucial for the long-term stability of the euro zone. So his views on whether the piecemeal agreement clinched in December is satisfactory to Washington is a key issue.     Lew will hold a news conference with French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici later. Separately, President Francois Hollande will meet European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso. Some EU officials have questioned the pace and depth of French labour and pension reforms.     The French economy is in dire need of a fillip. Consumer confidence figures, just out, edged up in December.     It may come today, it may come later in the week but Ireland is about to launch a new syndicated 10-year bond, the first since it exited its bailout in December. Even though the government is already funded into 2015, this will be an important test of confidence and the country's ability to stand on its own feet. It is expected to try and raise a modest 3 billion euros.     Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan is in Japan as part of an Asian tour, proclaiming that his country's gaping current account gap will pose no threat to the economy for the next four or five years. With a new bout of emerging market volatility quite possible as the Federal Reserve starts drawing in its claws, that could well be put to the test.     Turkey's stock market rose more than 3 percent yesterday, having been battered by a corruption scandal that has led to the resignation of three cabinet ministers and questioned the independence of the judiciary and police, with reports saying the government removed another 350 police officers from their posts overnight.

Consumer inflation in the 17 countries sharing the euro stood at 0.8 percent year-on-year in the last month of 2013, compared with 0.9 percent in November, data from the EU's statistics office Eurostat showed on Tuesday.      December's reading takes inflation back to near a four-year-low of 0.7 percent in October.      Prices of food, alcohol and tobacco rose by 1.8 percent on the year in December after 1.6 percent growth in November, while the volatile price of energy showed no change, following a 1.1 percent drop in the previous month.     The October drop in inflation was the first fall below 1 percent since February 2010 and prompted the European Central Bank to cut its key interest rate to a new record low of 0.25 percent in November.     ECB President Mario Draghi said last week there were no signs of deflation or an urgent need for another rate cut, adding that it was vital to avoid a scenario where inflation gets stuck permanently below one percent and slips into a danger zone for the economy.     However, the euro zone is still far from the deflation that Japan suffered from the early 1990s.     Eurostat's separate data release showed euro zone industrial producer prices eased their decline in November to fall by 0.1 percent on the month after a 0.5 percent drop in October, putting the annual rate at -1.2 percent, compared with a nearly four-year low of -1.3 percent seen in October.     The monthly drop was led by a 0.2 percent fall in costs of intermediate goods while prices of capital, durable, non-durable goods and energy prices were flat compared with October.     Changes in producer prices, unless absorbed by retailers, eventually translate into changes in the consumer price index.          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For a TABLE on Dec inflation see:             [ID:nB5E8KL02F] For a TABLE on Nov producer prices see:          [ID:nB5E8KL02E] For more details: http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/eurostat/home For a GRAPHIC see:             http://link.reuters.com/kuj24s ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   (Reporting by Martin Santa)  ((martin.santa@thomsonreuters.com)(+32 2 287 6854)(Reuters Messaging: martin.santa.reuters.com@reuters.net))  Keywords: EUROZONE ECONOMY/",20140107100745nL6N0KH125,nL6N0KH125

Eonia <EONIA=>, an average of interest rates at which euro zone banks lend to each other overnight, surged to a two-year high of 0.446 percent at the end of 2013 as thin liquidity forced banks to overpay for cash, before falling back as markets returned to normal.     Banks stocked up on liquidity to ward off the market tension toward the end of the year, taking more than expected from the European Central Bank at its extended weekly refinancing operation last week.      The ECB made efforts to avoid any liquidity squeeze and suspended repayments of its long-term refinancing operations until Jan. 15.     The central bank is set to meet on Thursday to discuss monetary policy for the 18 countries that use the euro as their currency, but economists do not expect any change yet.     Excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> - the amount of money in the market beyond what banks need for their day-to-day operations - stood at 277 billion euros, having fallen to about 150 billion euros in December.     On Tuesday, the three-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR3MD=>, traditionally the main gauge of unsecured bank-to-bank lending, remained at 0.280 percent.

Bernanke, who steps down as head of the U.S. central bank at month's end, gave an upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy in coming quarters. But he tempered the positive signs in the housing sector, financial markets and fiscal policies by repeating that the overall recovery clearly remains incomplete in the United States.     In what came as a surprise to some, the Fed decided last month to cut its asset-purchase program, known as quantitative easing, or QE, by $10 billion to $75 billion per month. It cited a stronger job market and economic growth in its landmark decision, which amounted to the beginning of the end of the largest monetary policy experiment ever. [ID:nW1N0IY00G]     But that decision did not indicate any diminution of (the Fed's) commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for as long as needed, Bernanke said at an American Economic Association forum in a snow-swept Philadelphia.     Rather, it reflected the progress we have made toward our goal of substantial improvement in the labor market outlook that we set out when we began the current purchase program in September 2012, he said.     U.S. Treasuries prices were modestly lower following Bernanke's remarks, while U.S. stock prices were higher in light trading.     To recover from the deep 2007-2009 recession, the Fed has held interest rates near zero since late 2008. It also has quadrupled the size of its balance sheet to around $4 trillion through three rounds of massive bond purchases aimed at holding down longer-term borrowing costs.     The Fed's extraordinary money-printing has helped drive stocks to record highs and sparked sharp gyrations in foreign currencies, including a drop in emerging markets last year as investors anticipated an end to the easing.     Looking into the years ahead, Bernanke said the central bank has the tools - including adjusting the rate on excess bank reserves and so-called reverse repurchase agreements, or repos - to return to a normal policy stance without resorting to asset sales.     It is possible, however, that some specific aspects of the Federal Reserve's operating framework will change, he said, predicting the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee would be mindful of the Fed's swollen balance sheet as it considers adjustments.     Bernanke's address at the downtown Philadelphia hotel attracted a standing room only audience, with many in the crowd economics students attending a conference to land jobs at the Fed and at major universities and institutions.           BALANCE SHEET SWELLS     While proponents of the Fed's three rounds of quantitative easing since the Great Recession point to the drop in joblessness and continued positive economic growth, opponents warn that benefits have diminished in the face of threats such as a run-up in future inflation.     Charles Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed, said the central bank faces immense challenges now that it has reduced bond-buying, and needs to be cognizant of a rapid rise in prices.     Dusting off arguments he and other hawkish officials made before the recent bout of low inflation, Plosser, a voter on policy this year, said at the conference that he was less concerned about disinflation and more concerned about too-high inflation if banks start to quickly release the $2.4 trillion in excess reserves they now hold.     Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, another hawk, said, however, that the unprecedented size of the balance sheet will not keep the Fed from being able to conduct effective monetary policy.     Speaking in Baltimore, he added: I expect further reductions in the pace of purchases to be under consideration at upcoming meetings. Only a sharp downturn in economic data would justify putting the tapering process on hold, he said.     Last month, Bernanke, who is set to be succeeded by Fed Vice Chair Janet Yellen, said the asset purchases would likely be cut at a measured pace through much of this year if job gains continued as expected, with the program fully shuttered by late-2014.     To temper the long-awaited tapering of bond-buying, the Fed also said it likely will be appropriate to keep overnight rates near zero well past the time that the jobless rate falls below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation expectations remain below target.     That was a noteworthy tweak to an earlier pledge to keep rates steady at least until the jobless rate, which dropped to a five-year low of 7.0 percent in November, hits 6.5 percent.     Bernanke - who again on Friday lauded the Fed's efforts to telegraph its intentions - said this move reaffirmed and clarified its plan for rates.          BRIGHTER SIGNS     Recent growth in jobs, retail sales and the housing market, as well as a fresh budget deal in Congress, has brightened U.S. prospects going into 2014. The trend has held in consumer spending as well as in manufacturing.     U.S. GDP growth hit a 4.1 percent annual rate in the third quarter, its fastest pace in almost two years. Economists generally expect between 2 and 3 percent growth for the fourth quarter, making for a solid end to the year for the world's largest economy.     Bernanke noted unemployment remains elevated at 7 percent, and said the number of long-term unemployed Americans remains unusually high.     But the combination of financial healing, greater balance in the housing market, less fiscal restraint, and, of course, continued monetary policy accommodation bodes well for U.S. economic growth in coming quarters, he said.     Of course, if the experience of the past few years teaches us anything, it is that we should be cautious in our forecasts.

Yellen, 67, the central bank's No. 2 since 2010, will take over as chair of the Fed after Ben Bernanke's term comes to a close at the end of this month. In doing so, she will take the reins of the world's largest economy and become the most powerful person in the world of finance.     Her well-deserved ascension to the chair knocks a notable hole in the glass ceiling that has for far too long kept women from the most powerful jobs in the country, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement.     Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, a liberal advocacy group, told Reuters she hoped Yellen's confirmation would pave the way for other women to climb to the top rungs of finance.      The financial industry is a place where women have been aggressively excluded from the top, top management, O'Neill said. Janet Yellen can make a difference.     Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of the 11 Republicans who voted for Yellen, expressed the same hope.     I wish that we had  more senior women in these financial circles, she said. And perhaps with her leadership that will act as a motivator to young women to get into the field.     In a 1995 interview, Yellen noted that women were under-represented at the highest levels of most groups and said she thought it would likely take a long time for that to change.     I've had a lot of opportunities in my life, Yellen told the Minneapolis Fed. I don't feel that I've faced discrimination. I've had every chance to succeed and more, and I think that's what all women should have.     Prior to becoming the Fed's vice chair, Yellen served as president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. She also had served a stint on the Fed's board in the 1990s and was a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton.     She is married and has an adult son, holds degrees from two Ivy League colleges -- Brown and Yale -- and taught at a third, Harvard.      She has written extensively on a wide variety of economic issues, particularly those involving the causes and implications of unemployment.     The confirmation of Janet Yellen to lead the Federal Reserve should be celebrated as a monumental step forward for our nation, said Neera Tanden, president of the liberal policy group Center for American Progress.     Yellen will take the helm at the Fed just as most of the central bank's other female Fed policymakers leave or prepare to depart: Fed Governor Elizabeth Duke left in August, Sarah Bloom Raskin is expected to vacate her board seat soon, and Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto has announced plans to retire.     Those departures leave just one woman besides Yellen in the top ranks at the Fed: Esther George, the chief of the Kansas City Fed, whose opposition to the central bank's massive monetary stimulus puts her at odds with the incoming Fed chief.

The news follows a flurry of banks announcing cuts to commodities trading, with Morgan Stanley <MS.N> selling its main physical oil trading unit to Russian state-run oil major Rosneft last month, Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> saying it was largely exiting commodities trading, and JPMorgan <JPM.N> putting its physical trading operations up for sale. [ID:nL6N0JZ3WB] [ID:nL5N0JK3ST]     The decision follows a recent review of its broader commodities activities and reflects the combined impact of lower client demand for European power and gas hedging and recent regulatory changes, a spokesperson for BoA-ML said in a statement.     The bank will continue trading power and gas in the United States as well as coal, commodity indices, oil and metals trading, the spokesperson said, adding the bank will dispose of its power and gas inventory through a formal sales process.     The sale and wind down of the business will include the bank's long-term sales and trading arrangements with power clients in the region, according to a person familiar the matter.     The bank has supply and sales arrangements with both the coal-fired 1,960 megawatt (MW) Eggborough plant in Yorkshire and a 1,000 MW gas-fired plant in Barking in the United Kingdom.     Reuters reported in October the bank has been waiting for more than three years for permission from the Federal Reserve to enter into so-called tolling arrangements with power plants, which would allow them to take a greater operational role in electrical utilities. [ID:nL1N0I51MN]     The bank has made a number of hires in other parts of its commodities business over the past year, however, including Barclay's former oil chief George Cultraro, to run its global crude and products trading business.

Yellen, 67, the central bank's No. 2 since 2010, will take over as chair of the Fed after Ben Bernanke's term comes to a close at the end of this month. In doing so, she will take the reins of the world's largest economy and become the most powerful person in the world of finance.     Her well-deserved ascension to the chair knocks a notable hole in the glass ceiling that has for far too long kept women from the most powerful jobs in the country, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement.     Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, a liberal advocacy group, told Reuters she hoped Yellen's confirmation would pave the way for other women to climb to the top rungs of finance.      The financial industry is a place where women have been aggressively excluded from the top, top management, O'Neill said. Janet Yellen can make a difference.     Senator Lisa Murkowski, one of the 11 Republicans who voted for Yellen, expressed the same hope.     I wish that we had  more senior women in these financial circles, she said. And perhaps with her leadership that will act as a motivator to young women to get into the field.     In a 1995 interview, Yellen noted that women were under-represented at the highest levels of most groups and said she thought it would likely take a long time for that to change.     I've had a lot of opportunities in my life, Yellen told the Minneapolis Fed. I don't feel that I've faced discrimination. I've had every chance to succeed and more, and I think that's what all women should have.     Anytime anyone is the first to achieve something of great import and notoriety -- that is a Big Deal, and in the case of Janet Yellen becoming the first female Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, it is HUGE, Ethan Siegal of the Washington Exchange, a private firm that tracks Washington for investors, wrote in an email to Reuters.    The Federal Reserve Board has basically had to step in over the past 5 years to be the only economic policy makers to show-up 24/7/365, and act with an air of confidence and maturity which is what you want from your National Leaders, Siegal added.     Prior to becoming the Fed's vice chair, Yellen served as president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank. She also had served a stint on the Fed's board in the 1990s and was a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton.     She is married and has an adult son, holds degrees from two Ivy League colleges -- Brown and Yale -- and taught at a third, Harvard.      She has written extensively on a wide variety of economic issues, particularly those involving the causes and implications of unemployment.     The confirmation of Janet Yellen to lead the Federal Reserve should be celebrated as a monumental step forward for our nation, said Neera Tanden, president of the liberal policy group Center for American Progress.     Yellen will take the helm at the Fed just as most of the central bank's other female Fed policymakers leave or prepare to depart: Fed Governor Elizabeth Duke left in August, Sarah Bloom Raskin is expected to vacate her board seat soon, and Cleveland Fed President Sandra Pianalto has announced plans to retire.     Those departures leave just one woman besides Yellen in the top ranks at the Fed: Esther George, the chief of the Kansas City Fed, whose opposition to the central bank's massive monetary stimulus puts her at odds with the incoming Fed chief.

Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, was the only policymaker to formally dissent against the Fed's decision last month to trim its bond-buying program. While he has long warned that high unemployment can permanently scar the labor market, on Tuesday he outlined the parallel threat posed by low prices.     Inflation rates persistently below the stated target can be a cause for real concern, Rosengren said in remarks prepared for delivery to a Connecticut business and industry association.     At very low inflation rates, a sizable negative shock to the economy can result in negative inflation - deflation - which can become entrenched in expectations, leading to a protracted period of deflation.     The Fed reduced to $75 billion, from $85 billion, the amount of assets it buys each month in an aggressive effort to spur investment and hiring in the protracted wake of the Great Recession. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has said that the program, known as quantitative easing, will likely be wound down throughout this year as the U.S. economy improves.     Rosengren, who will not have a vote on policy this year under the Fed's rotating system, is to the dovish side of the spectrum of Fed policymakers. The doves have generally held sway since the recession, but that may now be changing since unemployment hit a five-year low of 7 percent in November and as concerns grow about pumping so much money into the economy.     Rosengren acknowledged that economic conditions are improving, and he expects gross domestic product growth of about 3 percent this year. Yet he questioned whether temporary factors were keeping inflation near 1 percent, below the Fed's 2 percent goal.     He said it was both striking and concerning that inflation remains so low well into the slow recovery from recession, especially given all the monetary stimulus from the Fed.     The Fed continues to miss both elements of its dual mandate from Congress -- inflation and employment -- by fairly large margins, Rosengren said in his remarks.      As the economy continues to improve, we should reduce and ultimately remove the unusual support the Fed has provided, he said. But this support should be removed only gradually.

Consumer price inflation in the 17 countries then sharing the euro stood at 0.8 percent year-on-year in the last month of 2013, compared with 0.9 percent in November, data from the EU's statistics office Eurostat showed on Tuesday.      December's reading takes inflation back to near a four-year-low of 0.7 percent in October.      Today's figures show that it's too early for the ECB to become complacent about deflation risks, especially in peripheral countries, said Peter Vanden Houte, ING's chief euro zone economist, referring to the bloc's weaker members.     An inflation rate that is well below the ECB's target of close-to-but-below 2 percent carries risks in the longer term because it can deflate wages and demand, depressing the economy.     Reacting to the data, the euro rose to $1.3646 from $1.3618 on speculation the ECB could consider more steps to support the economy.[ID:nL6N0KH11U]     The October drop in inflation was the first fall below 1 percent since February 2010 and prompted the European Central Bank to cut its key interest rate to a new record low of 0.25 percent in November.     Still, the euro zone is far from the deflation that Japan suffered from the early 1990s.     ECB President Mario Draghi said last week there were no signs of deflation or an urgent need for another rate cut, but added that it was vital to avoid a scenario where inflation gets stuck permanently below one percent and slips into a danger zone for the economy.     While we believe that for the time being the ECB will keep its monetary policy unchanged, not much is needed to push the central bank into action, said Vanden Houte.     Analysts see the ECB staying on hold at its rate-setting meeting on Thursday, while watching out for any action the bank may take in reaction to current low inflation environment.     We believe the ECB will most likely enact its Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) in the next few months, which may very well be tailored specifically towards bank lending, said IHS chief European economist Howard Archer.      ECB Governing Council members have signalled the bank will provide more money to banks by the time the cheap long-term loans it has already made expire. The ECB injected more than 1 trillion euros into the banking system via three-year loans in December 2011 and February 2012, which means the first tranche of repayments is due in late 2014.     Eurostat's separate data release showed euro zone industrial producer prices eased their decline in November to fall by 0.1 percent on the month after a 0.5 percent drop in October, putting the annual rate at -1.2 percent, compared with a nearly four-year low of -1.3 percent seen in October.     The monthly drop was led by a 0.2 percent fall in costs of intermediate goods while prices of capital, durable, non-durable goods and energy prices were flat compared with October.     Changes in producer prices, unless absorbed by retailers, eventually translate into changes in the consumer price index.

Investors are likely to weigh more carefully what such an approach might mean for U.S. monetary policy after she was  confirmed by the Senate on Monday to succeed Ben Bernanke at the helm of the central bank.     Economists at Goldman Sachs think optimal control considerations mean the central bank is likely to hold off raising interest rates for longer than many financial market participants expect.     Might a Yellen Fed raise interest rates too slowly and allow inflation to get out of control? Or is the bigger risk that it tightens policy prematurely and inflicts another recession?     Optimal policy -- a technical term economists use to describe maximizing good outcomes -- will help frame that debate.                  WHAT IS IT?     Yellen first talked publicly about an optimal control path for rates in a June 2012 speech. But the idea of a mathematical model to summarize policy trade-offs -- in this case between unemployment and inflation -- is common to economics.      It describes a way to set policy that optimizes economic outcomes according to the Fed's dual mandate for price stability and maximum sustainable employment.     As described by Yellen, the Fed could achieve a faster reduction in U.S. unemployment at the modest price of a bit more temporary inflation than it would get if it set policy with rigid respect for its 2 percent inflation goal.     I assume that monetary policy aims to minimize the deviations of inflation from 2 percent and the deviations of the unemployment rate from 6 percent, with equal weight on both objectives, she said in November 2012. At the time, 6 percent was the upper edge of the range of jobless rates that the Fed felt was in keeping with full employment.     When she ran the numbers for that speech, the model suggested the Fed should hold rates near zero until early 2016, and keep them lower than recommended by a more traditional policy rule until 2018.      The payoff would be unemployment falling to 6.5 percent by mid-2015, versus 7 percent under what was then the Fed's baseline forecast, and 7.5 percent if the Fed followed the more traditional rule that recommended earlier rate hikes.          WHAT CRITICS SAY     Skeptics say the optimal control approach may optimize economic outcomes, but it lacks control and increases the risk of a policy error.     The optimal control framework actually provides the illusion of control without necessarily control itself, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist for Northern Trust in Chicago.     By tolerating higher inflation to achieve its employment goal, critics worry the Fed might not realize it has a problem until it is too late.     Further, they worry that the inflation and unemployment goals are too loosely defined to keep the central bank on the straight and narrow. The Fed targets 2 percent inflation, but shoots for that goal over the medium term.      As for the jobless rate it tries to achieve, officials now say it is likely between 5.2 percent and 5.8 percent, but they don't know for sure and admit it could change over time.     You might end up with the Fed probably being able to justify a broad range of actions on the basis of the same set of data, said Tannenbaum. It may seem more scientific than it actually is.                    SUPPORTERS' VIEW     Economists who think Yellen is on the right track prefer to think about the optimal control approach as a common sense way to describe a problem faced by the Fed when inflation is lower than desired, as is currently the case.     Optimal control is just language for pointing out that in that case, it is a much clearer policy choice, if you think inflation at the moment is too low and ... unemployment is too high, said James Hamilton, an economics professor at the University of California, San Diego.     Also, the risk of a policy mistake cuts both ways, and a decision to tighten policy too soon might mean hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans being without work for longer than would have otherwise been the case.     You have to acknowledge that may be having a permanent effect on people's lives, and for that matter a permanent effect on what we can accomplish as a nation, Hamilton said.          WHAT IS THE FED DOING NOW?     Yellen has said the model is instructive and a useful guidepost, but that it's no replacement for judgment. She has said she would never advocate turning over monetary policy to a computer.     The Fed, however, has taken steps that are very much in keeping with the spirit behind an optimal control approach.      To convince financial markets they will keep rates low for a long time, officials had said they would not raise rates at least until unemployment hit 6.5 percent, provided the outlook for inflation stayed under 2.5 percent.      On Dec. 18 the Fed tweaked that pledge, saying it likely would be appropriate to keep rates near zero well past the time that the jobless rate fell below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation expectations remained below target.     The U.S. jobless rate in November was 7.0 percent.

Consumer price inflation in the 17 countries then sharing the euro stood at 0.8 percent year-on-year in the last month of 2013, compared with 0.9 percent in November, data from the EU's statistics office Eurostat showed on Tuesday.      December's reading takes inflation back to near a four-year-low of 0.7 percent in October.      Today's figures show that it's too early for the ECB to become complacent about deflation risks, especially in peripheral countries, said Peter Vanden Houte, ING's chief euro zone economist, referring to the bloc's weaker members.     An inflation rate that is well below the ECB's target of close-to-but-below 2 percent carries risks in the longer term because it can deflate wages and demand, depressing the economy.     Reacting to the data, the euro rose to $1.3646 from $1.3618 on speculation the ECB could consider more steps to support the economy.[ID:nL6N0KH11U]     The October drop in inflation was the first fall below 1 percent since February 2010 and prompted the European Central Bank to cut its key interest rate to a new record low of 0.25 percent in November.     Still, the euro zone is far from the deflation that Japan suffered from the early 1990s.     ECB President Mario Draghi said last week there were no signs of deflation or an urgent need for another rate cut, but added that it was vital to avoid a scenario where inflation gets stuck permanently below one percent and slips into a danger zone for the economy.     While we believe that for the time being the ECB will keep its monetary policy unchanged, not much is needed to push the central bank into action, said Vanden Houte.     Analysts see the ECB staying on hold at its rate-setting meeting on Thursday, while watching out for any action the bank may take in reaction to current low inflation environment.     We believe the ECB will most likely enact its Long-Term Refinancing Operation (LTRO) in the next few months, which may very well be tailored specifically towards bank lending, said IHS chief European economist Howard Archer.      ECB Governing Council members have signalled the bank will provide more money to banks by the time the cheap long-term loans it has already made expire. The ECB injected more than 1 trillion euros into the banking system via three-year loans in December 2011 and February 2012, which means the first tranche of repayments is due in late 2014.     Eurostat's separate data release showed euro zone industrial producer prices eased their decline in November to fall by 0.1 percent on the month after a 0.5 percent drop in October, putting the annual rate at -1.2 percent, compared with a nearly four-year low of -1.3 percent seen in October.     The monthly drop was led by a 0.2 percent fall in costs of intermediate goods while prices of capital, durable, non-durable goods and energy prices were flat compared with October.     Changes in producer prices, unless absorbed by retailers, eventually translate into changes in the consumer price index.

Policymakers want to rein in excessive trading risks in the EU banking sector, whose assets total some 43 trillion euros ($59 trillion), that could threaten depositors if trades go wrong and potentially put taxpayers on the hook in a rescue.     Yet the EU proposal, seen by Reuters on Monday, has already been described as a watered-down measure designed to ensure approval across the bloc and which is less rigorous than equivalent Volker Rule regulations being introduced in the United States.     Despite its language banning proprietary trading - where banks trade on their own account and not on behalf of a customer - one financial industry lobbyists called the proposal a cop-out compromise.     The lobbyist said it gives countries like France and Germany leeway to avoid splitting up their big universal banks into separate deposit-taking and more risky investment banking operations.     Brussels had already signalled it would stop short of too radical measures given political unease over breaking up big banks and giving a competitive advantage to non-EU rivals.     The proposal is being finalised by EU financial services chief Michel Barnier, who will formally publish it as a draft law within weeks, with further changes possible before then.     Barnier does not want to make any waves during the remainder of his term, one financial industry official said. Barnier's term ends when the current commission is replaced on Oct. 31.          GLOBALLY SYSTEMIC      The proposal would apply to all the bloc's banks, but  proprietary trading would only be banned at about 30 top lenders, defined as having total assets of more than 30 billion euros, or who are already deemed to be globally systemic such as Barclays <BARC.L>, BNP Paribas <BNPP.PA> and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE>.     Proprietary trading is defined narrowly, so a bank can continue to trade on behalf of customers and make markets, or quote buy and sell prices in securities.         Accordingly, desks, units, divisions or individual traders specifically dedicated to taking positions for making a profit for (their) own account, without any connection to customer activity or hedging the entity's risk, would be prohibited, the proposal says.     Some trading activities, like lending to private equity funds, deals involving derivatives and complex securitisations, and typically carried out for customers, may also have to be carved out into separate entities.     The United States has gone further and has just approved its Volcker Rule, which imposes a mandatory ban on leading banks from making bets on securities or other assets on their own account. The rule will take effect in July 2015, but is being challenged by U.S. banks in the courts.         With the European Parliament going to the polls in May and a new European Commission appointed by October, approval of what will be highly contested legislation is unlikely before 2015 and won't take effect until about 2017.     Barnier's proposal seeks a pan-EU approach that would allow national initiatives in the pipeline to continue, and draws on a report from Finnish central bank governor Erkki Liikanen.          UNILATERAL STEPS      Liikanen recommended a mandatory separation of a bank's deposit-taking activities from significant proprietary trading, but France, Britain and Germany, representing a large chunk of EU banking assets, have already taken unilateral steps to tackle risks from trading.     Britain, for example, is introducing its Vickers reform which requires deposit-taking arms of banks to be ring-fenced, or protected with an extra cushion of capital.     The EU proposal sets out derogations or exemptions from an automatic proprietary trading ban, so Germany, for example, won't have to necessarily physically split up Deutsche Bank.     Exemptions would be allowed if a national supervisor introduces special measures to ensure the effective separation of certain activities to prevent financial instability, a wording financial experts say gives countries leeway.     Alexandria Carr, a regulatory lawyer at Mayer Brown in London, said Barnier was seeking a compromise with everyone.         It (the measure) seeks to compromise between Volcker and Vickers, to compromise between the lobbying of the consumer associations and the financial sector, and to compromise between the positions of the UK on one hand and France and Germany on the other, said Carr.     It remains to be seen whether the proposal that the Commission publishes will take a more defined position but, on the present draft, the concern must be that in seeking to please everyone, the Commission will please no-one, Carr said.     Some financial experts have also interpreted the proposal as exempting huge banks like HSBC <HSBA.L> because of its global structure based on country-focused subsidiaries.     The proposal also seeks to stop banks from circumventing any ban by preventing them from holding stakes in hedge funds that could take trading bets on their behalf.

The U.S. central bank has held benchmark interest rates near zero for five years and quadrupled its balance sheet to about $4 trillion through three massive bond-buying programs.     As those efforts bear fruit, Yellen is expected to extricate the Fed from its super-easy policy stance, first by managing further reductions to the central bank's bond buying and, eventually, by raising rates from rock-bottom levels.     Her approach to that delicate task will be informed by views shaped through decades of policymaking and research. A snapshot of those views follows:          JOBS     As the Fed's vice chair since 2010 and the chief of the San Francisco Fed before that, Yellen has helped shape the Fed's ultra-easy monetary policy. She is not shy about her belief, at odds with some of her more traditionally minded colleagues, that the Fed can do a lot to alleviate unemployment.      In a speech on March 4, she said that progress in the labor market should take center stage in monetary policy.     I consider it imperative that we do what we can to promote a very strong recovery, she said at her confirmation hearing in November. We're doing that by continuing our asset purchase program, which we ... put into place with the goal of assuring a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.           INFLATION     Yellen believes that it is rare for the Fed's two goals - maximizing employment and keeping inflation low and stable - to conflict. But when they do, she said in 1995, a wise and humane policy is occasionally to let inflation rise even when inflation is running above target, if doing so allows the Fed to bring down unemployment more rapidly.      Given her stance, some critics worry Yellen could let inflation spin out of control. But her credentials also suggest she will be keeping a watchful eye. In 1996, she urged then-Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to consider raising rates to head off inflation, and just as she has never dissented on a rate-cutting decision, she also has never withheld her support in a vote to raise rates.          QUANTITATIVE EASING     Yellen has backed the Fed's bond buying, saying its benefits exceed its costs. She voted, however, in favor of the Fed's Dec. 18 decision to modestly trim the pace of its monthly bond purchases to $75 billion from $85 billion.     There are dangers, frankly, on both sides of ending the program or ending accommodation too early, Yellen told senators in November. There are also dangers that we have to keep in mind with continuing the program too long or more generally keeping monetary policy accommodation in place too long.          FORWARD GUIDANCE     The Fed is trying to keep downward pressure on long-term borrowing costs by promising not to begin raising overnight rates at least until the unemployment rate drops to 6.5 percent, provided the outlook for inflation remains under 2.5 percent.     It tweaked that pledge on Dec. 18, saying it likely would be appropriate to keep rates near zero well past the time that the jobless rate fell below 6.5 percent, especially if inflation expectations remained below target. The jobless rate in November was 7.0 percent.     Despite the shift in language, some economists continue to think the Fed may decide to lower the jobless rate threshold as a way to signal a steadfast commitment to low interest rates.     Yellen has not tipped her hand on her views, but she has suggested rates could stay low regardless.      (T)he thresholds are not triggers, she said in a letter to a senator in November. Monetary policy is likely to remain highly accommodative long after one of the economic thresholds for the federal funds rate has been crossed.       ASSET BUBBLES     One criticism of the Fed's ultra-easy policy stance is that it could inflate another asset bubble. Yellen has consistently shot down those concerns.     Still, she has hinted at a more muscular approach to regulation and the possibility she would support using monetary policy if needed to keep bubbles from destabilizing the financial system.      I absolutely believe that our supervisory abilities are critical, and they're just as important as monetary policy, she told senators. I would not rule out using monetary policy as a tool to address asset price misalignments, but because it is a blunt tool ... I would like to see monetary policy used first and foremost towards achieving those goals Congress has given us, and to use other tools in the first instance to try to address potential financial stability threats.      TOO BIG TO FAIL     Yellen believes that policymakers are making progress on addressing the problem of so-called too-big-to-fail financial institutions, but wants banks to hold more capital and meet higher liquidity and supervision standards.      COMMUNICATION     In January 2012, the Fed adopted an explicit inflation target, a step that Yellen had long pushed for inside the once-secretive institution. The challenges facing our economy in the wake of the financial crisis have made clear communication more important than ever before, Yellen said in late 2012, just weeks before the Fed took another big step in what Yellen has called a communication revolution at the Fed: using economic indicators as explicit thresholds for monetary policy change.     Look for Yellen to tweak and expand Fed communications, possibly with more news conferences and more detailed forecasts from policymakers.

Last month Morgan Stanley <MS.N> sold its main physical oil trading unit to Russian state-run oil major Rosneft, and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> said it was largely exiting commodities trading. In July, JPMorgan <JPM.N> put its physical trading operations up for sale. [ID:nL6N0JZ3WB] [ID:nL5N0JK3ST]     The sector is now dominated by commodities trading houses and utilities, with Barclays, Citi and Goldman Sachs among the only remaining large banks with a significant presence.     Difficulties around speculative trading in the growing renewables market has also dented profitability, traders say.     BofA-ML had been scaling back its trading presence in the European power and gas market over the past few months, a trading source, who has done business with the firm, said.     The group had not been a big player in the markets since Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch in 2008, the source said.     The decision follows a recent review of its broader commodities activities and reflects the combined impact of lower client demand for European power and gas hedging and recent regulatory changes, a BoA-ML spokesperson said in a statement.     The bank's European carbon trading desk will also be reduced but will not be shut entirely, a source familiar with the matter said.     Employees affected by the power and gas desk closure were told of the news on Tuesday, with a low double-digit number of staff affected, the source said.     BofA-ML will continue trading power and gas in the United States as well as coal, commodity indexes, oil and metals trading, the spokesperson said, and the bank will dispose of its power and gas inventory through a formal sales process.     Long-term sales and trading arrangements with power clients will be wound down, according to a person familiar the matter.     The bank has supply and sales arrangements with both the coal-fired 1,960 megawatt (MW) Eggborough plant in Yorkshire and a 1,000 MW gas-fired plant in Barking, also in Britain.     Barking Power declined to comment and no one at Eggborough Power was immediately available for comment.     Reuters reported in October the bank has been waiting for more than three years for permission from the Federal Reserve to enter into so-called tolling arrangements with power plants, which would allow them to take a greater operational role in electrical utilities. [ID:nL1N0I51MN]     The bank has made a number of hires in other parts of its commodities business over the past year, however, including Barclay's former oil chief George Cultraro, to run its global crude and products trading business.

Higher money market rates effectively tighten monetary conditions, which the ECB loosened only in November by cutting its refinancing rate to a record low of 0.25 percent.      The ECB meets on Thursday, and while it is widely expected to take no action this time, it will be keeping a close eye on the money market as well as on weak inflation.     While lenders relying less on central bank cash generally indicates that money market tensions have eased, the resulting drop in liquidity also pushes up market rates, which if prolonged could hamper the economic recovery.     There are worries that liquidity will wilt away, and this means that the ECB could have to take action, Nordea analyst Jan von Gerich said.     On Tuesday, banks took 112.5 billion euros ($153.5 billion) in the ECB's main weekly refinancing operation - 56 billion euros less than the week before, when they were stocking up for the tense end-of-the-year period.     The ECB also successfully drained funds to offset government bonds bought under its now-ended bond-buying programme, after three consecutive failures. Banks will deposit 179 billion euros at the ECB for a week - 74 billion euros more than in the previous operation on Dec. 30.     This all means that on Wednesday, when these transactions are settled, euro zone money markets will be down by 130 billion euros, which could mean excess liquidity - the amount of money in the market beyond what banks need for their day-to-day operations - falls to about 150 billion euros from the current 277 billion.     While one week does not fundamentally change the tone, this confirms the direction of earlier last year, von Gerich said.     In a Reuters poll last month, 25 of 40 respondents said the ECB would increase liquidity through a third long-term loan, probably early in 2014. [ID:nL6N0JQ2MN]     The ECB will see no need to act (this month), but will think of options, such as a targeted long-term liquidity operation, von Gerich said. It won't take much in the way of bad news for the ECB to act.     Euro zone inflation fell in December after a small increase the previous month, adding to the challenge the ECB faces in avoiding deflation while supporting the bloc's recovery. [ID:nL6N0KH15J]     ECB President Mario Draghi has said that if the central bank did inject more cash, it would have to ensure that any additional long-term money is not just used to buy government debt, as it was when the ECB poured in more than 1 trillion euros in two operations in late 2011 and early 2012.      Other options for the ECB include cutting interest rates, taking its deposit rate into negative territory or no longer offsetting its bond purchases, which would add 179 billion euros to the market immediately, or cutting its reserve requirements.     In November and December, when excess liquidity also fell to around 150 billion euros, short-term market interest rates rose. That trend could resume, especially when voluntary paybacks of three-year central bank loans resume next week.     The ECB's twin three-year cash operations in late 2011 and early 2012 helped push up excess liquidity to more than 800 billion euros.     Those loans will expire in about a year's time, but banks have used the early repayment option and returned almost half the money to the ECB already.

When she succeeds Ben Bernanke, whose second four-year term as Fed chairman expires on Jan. 31, Yellen will become the first woman to run the Fed in its 100-year history and just one of a handful of women heading central banks globally. She is currently the Fed's vice chair.     The vote to approve her was 56-26. Yellen won resounding support from Democrats, but many Republicans voted no.     The Fed cut overnight interest rates to near zero in late 2008 and has quadrupled its balance sheet to more than $4 trillion through a series of massive bond purchase programs meant to push down longer-term borrowing costs.     Yellen, 67, spent years defending those efforts, arguing both as Bernanke's deputy and before that as head of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank that they would reduce borrowing costs and spur hiring and economic growth.      Now those policies appear to be working: the U.S. unemployment rate fell in November to a five-year low of 7 percent and the economy grew in the third quarter of 2013 at its fastest pace in almost two years.      Yellen's main task in the world's most powerful financial post likely will be to navigate the central bank's way out of its extraordinary stimulus, beginning with dialing down its bond-buying program.          In December, Bernanke began the process, leading the central bank to its landmark decision to shave the bond purchases to $75 billion this month from a previous monthly pace of $85 billion.     The entire program, known as QE3 because it is the Fed's third such effort at so-called quantitative easing, will likely be shuttered by late 2014 so long as the economic recovery proceeds as forecast, Bernanke said.     Many Republicans and several of Yellen's own Fed colleagues see the wind-down of that program as long overdue and warn that the buildup of bonds on the Fed's balance sheet could stoke inflation or asset-price bubbles.     This expansionary monetary policy cannot continue into perpetuity without causing real and lasting damage to our economy, said Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican.     Those concerns notwithstanding, analysts by and large expect Yellen to stick with the dovish approach to policy that she has long been known for, with a focus on reducing unemployment, particularly if inflation continues to run well below the Fed's 2 percent target.      Yellen has long argued that the Fed should tolerate slightly higher inflation if that is the cost of fighting high unemployment. But she has also advocated interest rate increases when she felt the threat of inflation called for them.     She is a strong person but she is also one who is open to other people's opinion and learns quickly, said Bill Rhodes, president of William R. Rhodes Global Advisors and a former senior vice chairman at Citigroup. I think there has been a tendency to underrate her ability, frankly.      Yellen is the first person appointed to an initial term as Fed chair by a Democratic president since Jimmy Carter named Paul Volcker to head the U.S. central bank in 1979. Although both Bernanke and his predecessor Alan Greenspan were reappointed by Democrats, their initial nominations were made by Republicans -- George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan, respectively.     And with Obama already one year into his second and last term as president, Yellen's appointment means his influence on economic policy will extend beyond his presidency.       <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     RELATED STORIES:     Yellen on rates, regulation, communications [ID:nL2N0K20M6]     Policy challenges looming for Yellen        [ID:nL2N0K20MA]     Yellen's 'optimal control' policy path      [ID:nL2N0K20ME]     Five facts about Yellen                     [ID:nL2N0K20MB]     More stories on Fed policy                  [FED/AHEAD]  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>       OLD HAND     Yellen's rise to the top of the world's most influential central bank marks an important milestone for women, long under-represented in the field of economics and finance.      She is breaking an incredibly important glass ceiling, Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, a liberal group that advocates for gender equality, told Reuters.      Even with the Fed's December decision to pare its bond buying and set out a road map for the wind-down, the Yellen Fed will have plenty of discretion. She could wait before making further reductions if the recovery stalls, or dial the program down faster should the job market strengthen unexpectedly.     The Fed sought to soothe investor angst over the reduction in asset purchases with a strengthened pledge to keep benchmark overnight interest rates low for a long time to come.     Maintaining the credibility of this pledge will be key to keeping rates from rising too far, too fast, a key challenge for Yellen as she faces the delicate task of setting the Fed back on the path to more normal monetary policy without rattling financial markets or disrupting the U.S. economic recovery.     As she confronts that assignment, Yellen will draw on years of experience as a top economic policymaker, including her six years as chief of the San Francisco Fed and her more than three years as the central bank's No. 2 official.     She also served on the Fed's board in the 1990s when Alan Greenspan was chairman and as a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton.     Yellen is a well-respected economics scholar and has taught at the Harvard University, the London School of Economics and the University of California, Berkeley.     Her research, some of it conducted with her Nobel-laureate husband George Akerlof, includes papers on topics as disparate as the rise in single motherhood, wage inflation and the negative effects of advertising.     As the Fed's vice chair, she spearheaded the central bank's adoption of a 2 percent inflation target and has championed the forward guidance the Fed has used to shape market expectations about the path of interest rates.     The central bank has said since December 2012 that it would hold rates near zero at least until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent, as long as inflation stays in check. Last month it said it expected to hold rates steady well past the time the jobless rate threshold is reached.          FILLING HOLES     Obama is expected to nominate former Bank of Israel head Stanley Fischer, an American-Israeli, to replace Yellen as vice chair.     But he will need to fill at least two other seats on the seven-member Fed board. One was left vacant when Elizabeth Duke departed in August and another is expected to be vacated soon when Sarah Bloom Raskin departs for the No. 2 job at the U.S. Treasury.      Yellen's road to the helm of the central bank was a highly political one that ran through last summer.     Obama only settled on her after his former economic adviser Lawrence Summers withdrew from consideration in the face of fierce opposition from within the president's own Democratic Party. That opposition, centering on questions about Summers' temperament for the top Fed job and concern over his part in deregulating the banking industry, raised doubts about his chances of winning Senate confirmation.

The policymaking Governing Council meets after data showed annual euro zone inflation dipped to 0.8 percent in December from 0.9 in November. The ECB targets inflation of just below 2 percent.     Core inflation, which strips out volatile costs like food and energy, hit a record low of 0.7 percent. [ID:nL6N0KH125]         The readout will heighten concerns at the ECB about entrenched price weakness taking hold, though strong company activity towards the of last year will give them some comfort. [ID:nL9E8E505B]     Obviously they are worried, but it's not significantly lower than it was a month earlier, Anders Svendsen at Nordea said. I don't think it's enough to prompt a new rate cut but I do think it's enough to keep them dovish and ready to act.     The ECB cut its main interest rate to a record low 0.25 percent in November after inflation slid to 0.7 percent. No change is expected this week, though ECB President Mario Draghi has stressed the bank still has room to act. [ID:nL3N0KD1S2][ID:nL5N0IS315]     We are not seeing any deflation at present, he told German magazine Der Spiegel late last month. But we must take care that we don't have inflation stuck permanently below one percent and thereby slip into the danger zone. [ID:nL6N0K707Q]     The ECB's readiness to contemplate using new policy tools means it is diverging from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is poised to wind down its stimulus this year. [ID:nW1N0IY00G]     Peter Praet, the ECB's chief economist, raised the possibility in November of the ECB embarking on asset buys - or quantitative easing (QE) - just as the Fed prepares to scale down its QE programme.     It would probably require a period of inflation at zero and lower - and the threat of a Japan-style lost decade that would pose - for a majority on the ECB council to support printing money.     The ECB has also vowed to keep interest rates at present or lower levels for an extended period. Other policy options include a new liquidity operation, which many economists expect the ECB to offer banks in the coming months.              COURT RULING     ECB policymakers, gathering for the first time after welcoming Latvia to the euro zone on Jan. 1, face a divergent inflation and growth picture across the 18-country bloc.     In Greece, annual inflation is running at minus 2.9 percent and the economy is in recession. In Germany, inflation is 1.2 percent and the private sector grew for the eighth month running in December.     Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, an arch-hawk on the ECB's Governing Council, said last month that although low interest rates were justified, weak inflation did not give a licence for arbitrary monetary easing. [ID:nB4N0I701T]     The ECB holds Thursday's meeting without Joerg Asmussen, another German who has given up his Executive Board seat to return to government in Berlin.     Asmussen has not yet been replaced, though Germany has proposed Bundesbank Vice President Sabine Lautenschlaeger to take his post. [ID:nL6N0JW2KW] Little is known about her views on monetary policy, though she will likely take a hawkish line.     The dynamics of the Governing Council will take on added significance ahead of a ruling expected soon by Germany's Constitutional Court on the ECB's OMT bond-buying programme - its as yet unused mechanism to protect the euro zone.     The court is considering whether the ECB's backstop of buying unlimited amounts of bonds from stricken euro zone states, announced in 2012 at the height of the bloc's debt crisis, is really a vehicle for funding member states through the back door. That could violate German law. [ID:nL5N0J63EK]     Any pressure to deploy further unorthodox, or non-standard, policy measures could risk upsetting the Bundesbank and change the mood music in Germany ahead of the ruling.     OMT remains the most important tool the ECB has committed to, so the German Constitutional Court ruling is important, said Christian Schulz at Berenberg bank.     If they (the ECB Governing Council) don't have to, they will probably try to avoid provoking an angry reaction in the German media, he said. If they can, I think they will hold fire and the data at the moment allows them to do that.

With unemployment, at 7 percent, well above healthy levels and inflation undesirably low, the economy needs continued stimulus from the central bank, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Arizona Bankers Association.     I want to stress that scaling back on asset purchases is not a retreat from accommodative monetary policy, Williams said. We're starting to ease off the gas, but we're nowhere near hitting the brakes yet.     The Fed has kept short-term interest rates near zero for more than five years and has swollen its balance sheet to an unprecedented $4 trillion through a series of bond-buying programs. The Fed's asset purchases, known as quantitative easing, are aimed at lower borrowing costs to spur investment and hiring after the worst downturn in decades.      Last month, amid unmistakable signs of a quickening recovery, the Fed took a first step towards dialing down that stimulus by trimming its $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program to $75 billion.      Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, who is serving his final month as U.S. central bank chief before Vice Chair Janet Yellen takes the reins on February 1, said the program would likely wind down in late 2014.      Williams - who was Yellen's research director at the San Francisco Fed until her promotion to Fed Vice Chair in 2010 -- reiterated the chairman's message in the context of a largely upbeat assessment of the recovery.      The U.S. economy will likely grow about 3 percent this year, up from a 2.5 percent pace last year, Williams said, fueled by a housing recovery that has been long in coming. With the recent budget deal in Washington, further significant spending cuts are unlikely, he said, and uncertainty is abating.     Inflation, currently about half the Fed's 2-percent goal, has likely bottomed out and will move slowly back to target over the next few years, he said. Add to that the encouraging signs from the job market, he said, and the time was right to start moving Fed monetary policy back to normal by reducing its bond purchases.       We will likely continue to reduce the pace of those purchases, and eventually eliminate them, over this year, said Williams, who does not vote on the Fed's monetary policy committee this year.      Even so, Williams said, the recovery still needs a boost. Reiterating the Fed's promise to keep rates low until well past the time that unemployment falls to 6.5 percent, as long as inflation stays below the Fed's goal, Williams forecast rates would stay near zero for the foreseeable future.

There, he urged Europe to do more to build up its bank backstops and capital, a fairly clear indication that Washington is underwhelmed by the German model of banking union which has prevailed.     Lew may also press for more German steps to boost domestic demand, after indirectly criticising Berlin for its policies during his last visit in April. If he does, he can expect a robust response from Schaeuble, at least in private.     Lew moves on to Portugal later in the day with Lisbon's planned exit from its EU/IMF bailout presumably top of the agenda when he meets Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho.     German trade data, just out, showed exports rose for a fourth month running in November but imports dropped quite sharply, pushing the trade surplus higher. So the imbalances that Washington and others in the G20 have complained about are there for all to see. Having said that the shale gas boon seems to be narrowing the U.S. deficit.     November German industry orders figures follow later. Orders dropped by a dramatic 2.2 percent in October so anything short of the forecast 1.5 percent rebound will be disappointing.     Euro zone unemployment and retail sales data for November are likely to offer little cheer, with the jobless rate holding at 12.1 percent.     Greece's six-month presidency of the European Union commences with joint statements from Prime Minister Antonis Samaras and European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso.     This may seem incongruous given the parlous state of the Greek economy but it offers an opportunity for Athens to run an efficient, low-cost presidency and to reassert its good European credentials, which could help a little when it comes to negotiate some form of debt relief later in the year.     Spain will spell out its 2014 funding plans after a year in which its debt was snapped up at lower and lower yields. Madrid will have to raise more money this year - a gross target of 244 billion euros from 235 billion in 2013. It has yet to outline how much of that will be in medium- and long-term bonds and how much it will raise through short-term T-bills.     Look at the charts going all the way back to the birth of the euro and they show the borrowing costs of Spain, Italy and Ireland - whose yields lurched lower yesterday after its first post-bailout bond issue was snapped up by investors - are down at the sort of levels seen before the global financial and euro debt crises struck.     The question is whether they are there on national merit or more because the market still believes in the European Central Bank's bond-buying backstop. The answer is probably a bit of both.     There's a flurry of central banking activity in central and Eastern Europe today with interest rate decisions from Poland and Romania and minutes of Hungary's last policy meeting at which rates were cut for the umpteenth time.     Poland is expected to keep rates at 2.5 percent at least until late in the year before pushing them higher. Inflation has unexpectedly slowed to a five-month low of 0.6 percent, defying expectations for a pick-up. Analysts expect the Romanian central bank to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to a record low of 3.75 percent.     Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk will spell out how his government plans to spend 73 billion euros from EU structural funds over 2014-2022 to create jobs and raise living standards. Tusk may give new growth forecasts and outline policies that would support job creation.

Athens will be financed by bailout loans until the second half of 2014, when it hopes to tap bond markets again. It then faces a funding gap of nearly 11 billion euros for 2014-15, according to the International Monetary Fund, one of the lenders, and is mulling ways to plug the hole.    The Hellenic Financial Stability Fund (HFSF), the bank rescue vehicle set up to recapitalise Greece's four big banks and cover the costs of winding down non-viable lenders, has a remaining capital buffer of about 10 billion euros.     Greece's international creditors, led by the European Central Bank, oppose the idea of tapping HFSF funds to plug the gap and want to keep the buffer as a safety cushion for banks, Kathimerini said, citing sources close to the talks.     Athens is keen for stress-test terms that will contain any additional capital needs for its top four banks and leave funds at the HFSF for its plans and has asked for a reduction in the required capital adequacy ratio to 8 from 9 percent.     The international creditors are oppose this reduction, the paper said.     The results of a health check on Greece's top four banks by the Bank of Greece are expected to be released later this month.     Apart from tapping HFSF funds, the paper said Greece's plans on plugging the 2014-15 funding gap also assume savings of about 3 billion euros from lower interest on official sector debt and raising money in the market with a small bond issue.     Twice bailed out with 240 billion euros by its euro zone partners and the International Monetary Fund, Greece expects a primary budget surplus this year, excluding debt interest payments, will allow it to get debt relief from its lenders.

Funding costs for euro zone companies began to diverge as the financial crisis laid bare country-specific risks, prompting investors to demand premiums in some member states.     More than five years on, that divergence persists despite the extraordinary measures implemented by the ECB.     The central bank ends its latest meeting on Thursday and is widely expected to keep all monetary policy settings on hold. [ID:nL6N0KG1ZX]     The ECB's measure of country-by-country variation of large corporate loan interest rates went up in November, although it held slightly below its peak reached earlier last year, ECB data showed on Wednesday.     The data showed that companies in Portugal had to pay 5.26 percent interest on new loans larger than 1 million euros in November compared with 5.01 percent in October. In Belgium, companies paid just 2.02 percent.     The ECB cut its main refinancing rate to a record low of 0.25 percent in November and is expected to keep it there until mid-2015, a Reuters poll showed. [ECB/INT]     But it may discuss other options to enhance the transmission of its interest rates when it meets on Thursday, after data last week showed that lending to euro zone companies contracted at the fastest pace on record in November.[ID:nL6N0K92GK]     ECB President Mario Draghi has commented on the problem before, telling a European parliament committee in mid-December: In this crisis, interest rate cuts have been transmitted more slowly and unevenly across euro area countries due to the fragmentation of financial markets.      To address this problem, we adopted in recent years a series of non-standard measures. The purpose of these was - and remains - a more effective transmission of the ECB's interest rate cuts, so that our monetary policy can reach companies and households throughout the euro area.

On Tuesday, banks took 112.5 billion euros ($153.07 billion) in the ECB's main weekly refinancing operation - 56 billion euros less than the week before, when they stocked up for the tense end-of-the-year period. [ID:nL6N0KH1M0]     The ECB also successfully drained funds to offset the full value of government bonds it still holds from its now-ended bond-buying programme, after three consecutive failures.     This means that excess liquidity <ECBNOMLIQ=> - the amount of money in the market beyond what banks need for their day-to-day operations - will fall to about 150 billion euros from 280 billion euros on Wednesday once the latest operations are taken into account.      A drop in liquidity is seen pushing up market rates as lenders rely less on central banks funding, with tension in money markets easing. But there is also a risk that if rates rise too quickly they may hold back the fragile recovery.     The ECB Governing Council will likely discuss the latest developments at Thursday's policy meeting, but economists expect the central bank to hold still for now. [ID:nL6N0KG1ZX]     On Wednesday, the three-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR3MD=>, traditionally the main gauge of unsecured bank-to-bank lending, rose to 0.281 percent from 0.280 percent.     The six-month Euribor rate <EURIBOR6MD=> ticked up to 0.383 percent from 0.381 percent, while the shorter-term one-week rate <EURIBORSWD=> jumped to 0.171 percent from 0.165 percent.     Overnight Eonia <EONIA=> rose to 0.099 percent on Tuesday from 0.096 percent in the previous session.     <^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     For a package of graphics on the ECB, click on:          http://link.reuters.com/neg32s        For graphic of euro zone liquidity levels click:            http://link.reuters.com/qeq25s      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>     Euribor rates are fixed daily by the Banking Federation of  the European Union (FBE) shortly after 1000 GMT.     * For a table of the latest Euribor fixings for terms of one week to one year, double click on <EURIBOR=>     * For a table of the previous day's fixings of EONIA swap  rates, which show market expectations for future overnight  lending rates, double click on <EONIAINDEX>     * For graphs of historic Euribor and EONIA swap rates, right click on the links in angle brackets below, and select 'Related Graph'       1 week    <EURIBORSWD=>    <EONIAINDEXSW=>     2 week    <EURIBOR2WD=>    <EONIAINDEX2W=>     1 month   <EURIBOR1MD=>    <EONIAINDEX1M=>     2 month   <EURIBOR2MD=>    <EONIAINDEX2M=>     3 month   <EURIBOR3MD=>    <EONIAINDEX3M=>     6 month   <EURIBOR6MD=>    <EONIAINDEX6M=>     9 month   <EURIBOR9MD=>    <EONIAINDEX9M=>     1 year    <EURIBOR1YD=>    <EONIAINDEX1Y=>  ($1 = 0.7349 euros)   (Reporting by Eva Taylor; Editing by Paul Carrel)  ((frankfurt.newsroom@reuters.com)(+49 69 7565 1209))  Keywords: MARKETS/EURIBOR",20140108100802nZYN0P2O00,nZYN0P2O00

Last month Morgan Stanley <MS.N> sold its main physical oil trading unit to Russian state-run oil major Rosneft, and Deutsche Bank <DBKGn.DE> said it was largely exiting commodities trading. In July, JPMorgan <JPM.N> put its physical trading operations up for sale. [ID:nL6N0JZ3WB] [ID:nL5N0JK3ST]     The sector is now dominated by commodities trading houses and utilities, with Barclays, Citi and Goldman Sachs among the only remaining large banks with a significant presence.     Difficulties around speculative trading in the growing renewables market has also dented profitability, traders say.     BofA-ML had been scaling back its trading presence in the European power and gas market over the past few months, said a trading source, who has done business with the firm.     The group had not been a big player in the markets since Bank of America took over Merrill Lynch in 2008, the source said.     The decision follows a recent review of its broader commodities activities and reflects the combined impact of lower client demand for European power and gas hedging and recent regulatory changes, a BoA-ML spokesperson said in a statement.     The bank's European carbon trading desk will also be reduced but will not be shut entirely, a source familiar with the matter said.     Employees affected by the power and gas desk closure were told of the news on Tuesday, with a low double-digit number of staff affected, the source said.     BofA-ML will continue trading power and gas in the United States as well as coal, commodity indexes, oil and metals trading, the spokesperson said, and the bank will dispose of its power and gas inventory through a formal sales process.     The bank has also let go three natural gas traders on its Houston desk, SparkSpread.com reported later in the day. A bank spokesman declined to comment on the departures or say whether they were related to winding down the European desks.     Long-term sales and trading arrangements with power clients will be wound down, according to a person familiar the matter.     The bank has supply and sales arrangements with both the coal-fired 1,960-megawatt (MW) Eggborough plant in Yorkshire and a 1,000-MW gas-fired plant in Barking, also in Britain.     Barking Power declined to comment and no one at Eggborough Power was immediately available for comment.     Reuters reported in October the bank has been waiting for more than three years for permission from the Federal Reserve to enter into so-called tolling arrangements with power plants, which would allow them to take a greater operational role in electrical utilities. [ID:nL1N0I51MN]     The bank has made a number of hires in other parts of its commodities business over the past year, however, including Barclay's former oil chief George Cultraro, to run its global crude and products trading business.
