Violent crime is rare in China compared with many other countries, but there has been a series of knife and axe attacks in recent years, many targeting children.

                "Guangzhou Rural Commercial Bank Co Ltd (GRCB) launched a Hong Kong initial public offering worth as much as $1.1 billion on Monday, seeking funds for potential M&A and to open new branches as it expands its lending and investment businesses.         The IPO for China's fifth-largest rural commercial bank by assets consists of 1.58 billion shares offered in an indicative range of HK$4.99-HK$5.27 each, according to a term sheet of the deal seen by Reuters.     That would be equivalent to around 16.5 percent of the lender after the offering, valuing it at as much as $6.7 billion.     GRCB did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.     The lender secured commitments worth about $431 million from three investors, including $195.1 million each from a unit of HNA Group and from Aeon Life Insurance Company Ltd, which is controlled by billionaire Wang Jianlin's Dalian Wanda Group.     Investment firm International Merchants Holdings plans to buy $40 million worth of shares.     The IPO is set to be priced on June 13, with its debut on the Hong Kong stock exchange slated for June 20.     ABC International, CCB International, China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC) and China Merchants Securities were hired as sponsors for the IPO, GRCB said in its preliminary IPO prospectus.

                "The Chinese yuan and Indian rupee are expected to shed some of this year's gains and weaken slightly against the dollar over the coming 12 months if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates further as expected, a Reuters poll showed.     China's yuan <CNY=CFXS> hit its highest in just over half a year on Wednesday and was last trading around 6.79 against the dollar.[CNY/]     The currency has gained nearly 2 percent so far this year, with half of that coming just in the last month.      The move comes on the heels of faster-than-expected growth of 6.9 percent in the Chinese economy in the first quarter of this year. But that was largely reliant on fiscal stimulus - the country's total social financing reached a record 6.93 trillion yuan ($137 billion) for the same period.     Another reason for concern is Moody's Investors' Service decision to cut China's credit rating for the first time in nearly 30 years, with debt continuing to rise. [nL4N1IQ07P]      The yuan is forecast to weaken to 7.05 per dollar in 12 months, according to the poll of over 50 foreign exchange analysts taken this week, even as market confusion reigns over China's plans to tweak the currency's midpoint calculation for a second time this year.     China said on Friday it was introducing an unspecified counter-cyclical factor, intended to discourage speculation and persistent depreciation pressure, though the currency had been largely stable earlier in the year as the dollar floundered.          The latest poll predictions were similar to last month's and based on similar Fed rate expectations for two more rate incrases this year.     While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates in June, which would be broadly supportive for the dollar, the currency has been whipsawed in recent weeks as hopes about the U.S. administration's economic growth plans have faded.     The top-down drivers for EM (emerging market) currencies suggest slightly stronger performance in spot for the near-term and depreciation over a 12-month horizon, noted Dirk Willer, head of emerging market strategy at Citi.      This implies only moderate strengthening in the USD, contributing to stability in the CNY and, by extension, other emerging market currencies. This is assumed to take place against the backdrop of moderately higher U.S. rates.          RUPEE SEEN WEAKENING MORE THAN 2 PERCENT     Separately, the Indian rupee <INR=IN> is forecast to weaken to 66.00 per dollar over the next year, a more than 2 percent fall from where it was trading on Wednesday after gaining more than 5 percent so far this year.     Official data on Wednesday showed India's economic growth unexpectedly slowed to its weakest in more than two years in the first three months of 2017, stripping the country of its status as the world's fastest growing major economy.     Still, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to stand pat when it meets on June 7, but carrying a less hawkish tone according to Reuters poll published this week.

                "Coal giant Shenhua Group Corp Ltd [SHGRP.UL] and top-five state power producer China Guodian Corp [CNGUO.UL] are in talks to merge some assets, sources told Reuters on Monday, as part of a broader shake-up of China's debt-ridden state-owned sector.     Several of the power firms' listed units suspended trading in their shares on Monday citing a planned significant event, fanning market speculation over a merger. The shares of other listed units that continued trading rose sharply.     The talks come as the government seeks to streamline state-owned enterprises (SOEs), including those in the energy sector, by creating huge, globally competitive conglomerates. It has merged 15 SOEs since 2015 and currently manages 103 - a number that could eventually fall to about 40, state media reported.     In the latest merger talks, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said China's largest coal miner, Shenhua Group, would take over Guodian unit GD Power Development Co Ltd <600795.SS>.     After merging Guodian's GD Power into Shenhua, Shenhua will consider acquiring coal-fired power assets from the remaining top power firms, said the person, who was not authorised to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified.     A second person with knowledge of the matter said merger talks were at a preliminary stage, and that the option of completely merging the two parents was likely to be tabled later.     Shenhua Group, its listed unit China Shenhua Energy Co Ltd <601088.SS>, China Guodian and GD Power could not be immediately reached for comment.     We think this merger is very likely to occur, NSBO Research said in a note to clients, referring to a merger of some form between Shenhua Group and China Guodian. Any merger would be positive for their listed units, NSBO Research said.          OVER-CAPACITY     China Guodian is one of five state power producers formed in 2002 after the restructuring of China's state-owned power sector monopoly, along with China Huadian Corp [CNHUA.UL], State Power Investment Corp [CPWRI.UL], China Huaneng Group [HUANP.UL] and China Datang Corp [SASADT.UL].     In March, the chairman of China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) said SOE restructuring would focus on the steel, coal, heavy equipment and coal-fired power sectors this year to tackle over-capacity. [nL3N1GM2MA]     With smog-plagued China moving toward cleaner fuel, a merger of Shenhua Group with a major state power provider such as China Guodian - also a leading hydropower and renewables developer - could ease its dependence on coal.     Other listed units of China Guodian - Guodian Changyuan Electric Power Co Ltd <000966.SZ>, Yantai LongYuan Power Technology Co Ltd <300105.SZ> and Ningxia Younglight Chemicals Co Ltd <000635.SZ> - also suspended share trading on Monday.     The listed firms said in statements they had been informed by their parent companies about a significant event that involved major uncertainties and required regulatory approvals.     Trading continued in the Hong Kong-listed shares of China Shenhua Energy <1088.HK> as well as Guodian Technology & Environment Group Corp Ltd <1296.HK>. The prices of both rose sharply in morning trading.
